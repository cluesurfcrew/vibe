// DOCKS BORN A BEAT PER VOLUME UNDER REGISTER GROWTH (E-CSM-0063), route H12b (note/research/vibe/roadmap/routes/
// gravity-cosmos-heat-classical.md, H · the cosmological constant): "Λ as an integration constant: if each beat adds a
// fixed number of docks per unit of husk volume, the volume element is fixed, which is unimodular gravity, where Λ is
// not a vacuum energy but a constant of integration." Test, in the route's words: "read the docks born a beat per husk
// volume under register growth, constant or not, exact". Kill: "the volume added a beat depends on content."
// OPEN-CSM-06.
//
// WHAT IS RUN. The register growth of E-FND-0168 (code/measure/register-growth: the plain wake, birth at root-step
// distance from one seed, one shell a beat; the one-body pieces of the register rule with the reflecting frontier; a born
// dock written empty) on the D4 tori of side 4 and 6 (128 and 648 docks), 8 cycles (16 beats), with three contents on the
// same growth: an EMPTY seed (no orbital), a FULL seed (the 192 member orbitals of a full dock at the seed), and a
// PLANTED LUMP (a full dock's 192 orbitals written at the first dock born at beat 2, at its birth). The births a beat are
// also counted on the unbounded D4 lattice (even coordinate sum in Z^4, the 24 roots) to beat 14, where no box wraps.
// The register growth is on D4, not on the {3,4,3,4} husk (route I1a's port is not built), so "volume" here is the
// grown region's dock count, and the newest shell, the region's own 3d edge, is read beside it.
//
// DERIVED BEFORE THE GATE RUN.
// 1. THE LAW READS NO STATE. The plain wake gives every dock its birth beat from the graph alone (torusWake reads the
//    neighbor table and the seed). So the docks added a beat cannot depend on content: the route's kill cannot fire by
//    the law's construction. What can fail is consistency: if any content reached a dock before its birth, a law blind
//    to content would be contradicted (the content would demand the dock earlier). The stream moves a slot one root step
//    a beat and the wake births one shell a beat, so after beat 0 no content passes the frontier (E-FND-0168 LC): the
//    weight on unborn docks should be exactly 0 for every content, including a lump written at the frontier itself.
// 2. HOW MANY A BEAT. On the unbounded D4 lattice the root-step shells should be b(0) = 1, b(t) = 8 t (2 t^2 + 1) for
//    t >= 1 (1, 24, 144, 456, 1056, ...; third differences constant 96), so the ball is V(t) = (2 t^2 + 2 t + 1)^2. Then
//    the docks born a beat per volume are b(t) / V(t - 1) = 8 t (2 t^2 + 1) / (2 t^2 - 2 t + 1)^2, about 4 / t, falling,
//    and per edge volume b(t) / b(t - 1) about 1 + 3 / t, falling to 1. Neither is constant: a fixed number per volume is
//    exponential growth, a constant H; this is a 4-ball growing by one radius a beat, a scale factor proportional to t, H
//    = 1 / t, the coasting reading E-CSM-0060 found on the horospheres. The number added a beat is fixed (a function of t
//    alone), which is the unimodular part of the route; the constant per volume is not.
// 3. THE CONTROL. E-GRV-0066's gated wake reads content: a dock opens 1 + max(0, E - 32) beats after its birth, so a
//    full dock (E = 48, as E-GRV-0066 assigns a full knit dock) waits 16. A full seed then delays every later shell by
//    16 beats, so its births a beat differ from the empty seed's, and the kill would fire on that law. (The register's
//    full dock has 192 members, not the knit's 48 units; E = 48 is the knit's full-dock energy, a stand-in for the
//    control only.)
//
// PROBES BEFORE THE GATES, disclosed. tmp/bv-probe1 (this file's code with PROBE_PLAN: side 4, 4 cycles, lattice to beat
// 8, gated box side 6): the lattice shells 1, 24, 144, 456, 1056, 2040, 3504, 5544, 8256 (third differences 96), per
// volume 24, 5.76, 2.698, 1.690, 1.214, 0.942, 0.767, 0.647; on side 4 the three contents had 0 weight on unborn docks,
// and their total weights drifted 1.7e-9 and 1.9e-9, which failed a first tolerance of 1e-9 and fixed WEIGHT_TOL at
// 1e-8 (E-FND-0168's count tolerance); the gated wake's full seed delayed every shell by 16 beats, and a lump at a
// distance-2 dock delayed none (the wake goes around it). tmp/bv-probe2: the side-8 gated box's plain shells 1, 24,
// 144, 456, 1044, ..., the lattice's to beat 3.
//
// HYPOTHESES AND GATES, fixed before the gate run.
//  E1 THE INSTRUMENT: in every content run on both sides the total weight stays its start plus 192 a planted dock within
//     1e-8 at every beat.
//  W0 THE COUNT: the torus wakes' shells equal the lattice's before the box wraps (beats below L / 2), and the lattice's
//     shells are 8 t (2 t^2 + 1) at every t = 1 .. 14 (read through the third differences, constant 96).
//  H1 CONTENT-BLIND (the route's unimodular part): on both sides the docks born at every beat are the same for the three
//     contents, and no content puts any weight on an unborn dock at any beat (exactly 0).
//  P1 THE KILL: the births differ between contents, or some content reaches an unborn dock. H1 fails exactly when P1
//     fires.
//  H2 CONSTANT PER VOLUME (the route's mechanism as stated; PREDICTED TO FAIL by 2): on the lattice, b(t) / V(t - 1) over
//     beats 7 .. 14 varies by at most 1 percent of its smallest value.
//  C1 THE CONTROL: on a side-8 gated box (4,096 docks) the full seed's births a beat differ from the empty seed's, and the
//     empty seed's gated shells equal the lattice's to beat 3.
// READ, gating nothing: the content's reach (docks holding weight above 1e-20) each beat against the births; b / V and
// b(t) / b(t - 1) at each beat; the gated lump's shells; seconds.
// VERDICT: fail if H1 fails (the kill fires) or H2 fails; partial if H1 and H2 hold and E1, W0 or C1 fails; pass
// otherwise. PREDICTED: fail on H2 alone, with the kill not firing.
//
// WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT SHOW. It can show, exactly, that the register growth adds a number of docks a beat that is a
// function of the beat alone, the same for every content tried, and that the dynamics never contradicts that (no content
// outruns the frontier), so the volume element is not dynamical: the unimodular premise holds for this growth law. And
// it can show whether that number is a fixed share of the volume. It cannot show that the plain wake is the model's
// growth (it is the least growth rule ported from the lattice gas, E-FND-0168, on D4, not on the {3,4,3,4} husk); a law
// that reads content, like the gated wake, would fire the kill. It does not give Λ a value: in unimodular gravity the
// constant is fixed by the history, and nothing here reads that constant.
//
// FIRST RUN 2026-10-02 (tmp/bv-run1.log, 55 s): FAIL on H2 alone, as derived; the kill does not fire. No gate moved and
// none was rerun.
//  - W0: the lattice shells 1, 24, 144, 456, 1056, 2040, 3504, 5544, 8256, 11736, 16080, 21384, 27744, 35256, 44016 at
//    beats 0 .. 14, each 8 t (2 t^2 + 1) (third differences 96); the torus wakes 1, 24, 74, 28, 1 (side 4) and 1, 24, 144,
//    286, 160, 32, 1 (side 6), the lattice's before the wrap.
//  - H1: the three contents share every birth on both sides, and none put weight on an unborn dock (exactly 0 in all six
//    runs). E1: total weight drift at most 2.0e-9 (side 4) and 8.6e-9 (side 6), under 1e-8. P1 does not fire.
//  - H2: b(t) / V(t - 1) reads 0.767, 0.647, 0.558, 0.491, 0.438, 0.395, 0.360, 0.330 at beats 7 .. 14, a factor 2.3, not
//    constant (t b / V = 4.63 at beat 14, tending to 4). Per edge volume b(t) / b(t - 1) falls 1.489 .. 1.249 over the
//    same beats, toward 1.
//  - C1: on the side-8 gated box the full seed holds every later shell back 16 beats (1, then 16 empty beats, then 24,
//    144, 456, ...), where the empty seed gives 1, 24, 144, 456, 1044, 1512, 792, 120, 3; a planted lump at a distance-2
//    dock moves one dock by one beat (455 and 1045 at beats 3 and 4).
//  - Read: the content fills the born region as fast as it is born: the full seed's weight is on 1, 24, 169, 455, 615,
//    647, 648 docks after beats 0 .. 6 on side 6 (the ball itself to beat 2, then the box), the lump's from its birth on.
//
// Depth L1: exact counts, and float amplitudes only for the consistency check, with reported residuals. DETERMINISM:
// every orbital is a fixed local basis vector; nothing is drawn.
