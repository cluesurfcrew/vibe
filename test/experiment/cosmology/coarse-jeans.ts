// JEANS ON THE COARSE LAYER (E-CSM-0062, OPEN-CSM-07, route I8a in ledger I "structure formation"). The route: the two
// conserved densities (love and fear, the only local conserved densities, E-FND-0170) plus the depth field give a coarse
// fluid; its Jeans length is the sound speed against the depth field's strength, and a density wave longer than it
// grows. Kill: no growing mode at any wavelength. This file builds that coarse fluid from measured pieces, writes its
// one-beat linear map at every wavenumber, runs a long density wave through it on a ring, and reads whether and how fast
// it grows.
//
// WHAT IS RUN. A coarse kinetic gas on the husk: the 24 husk shadows of the D4 roots (axes twice at speed 1, face
// diagonals once at sqrt 2, second moment 12 I, so c_s^2 = 1/2 exactly, E-MTH-0013). A density wave along a husk axis,
// uniform across it, is carried exactly by the shadows' axis components: 6 slots at +1, 12 at 0, 6 at -1, weights 1/4,
// 1/2, 1/4 (a D1Q3 gas with c_s^2 = 1/2). Two species, love and fear, each with its count kept by the collision. The
// collision is a single relaxation (BGK) at the rate that gives the knit's measured viscosity, nu = c_s^2 (1/w - 1/2) =
// 0.469 (E-FLD-0030), in two closures:
//   KNIT       the collision keeps the total momentum too (the knit's coarse layer, which carries sound);
//   REGISTER   the collision relaxes momentum to rest (the register rule keeps no local momentum density, E-FND-0170),
//              so the gas diffuses, D = c_s^2 (1/w - 1/2), with mobility 1/w - 1/2 (inertia 1 per unit of content).
// THE DEPTH FIELD, as E-GRV-0090 and 0091 have it: content (love + fear) sources the depth, and a unit of content at r
// feels the acceleration -(pi / D) grad G(r) per unit of source content, G the husk lattice Green's function (symbol
// lambda(k) = sum over the 24 shadows of 1 - cos(k . r_d), which is 12 (1 - cos k) along an axis), D = 16 the headroom
// (E-GRV-0091's closed form; inertia per unit of content is its stand-in, 1). On the ring the potential is Phi(k) =
// -(pi / D) n(k) / lambda(k) for k != 0; the uniform part is removed (the torus solve counts from the mean, as E-GRV-0148
// counts from the sea), and the gradient is the centered difference (symbol i sin k). The force on each species is its
// own density times -grad Phi (both fall alike, E-GRV-0091). The field is the content-solved depth, which acts at once;
// the radion carries it at about c (E-GRV-0091), which this coarse run leaves out.
// THE BEAT: compute n, j and Phi; collide with the force (Guo's scheme: the equilibrium velocity shifted by half the
// force, the forcing term (1 - w/2) w_v v F / c_s^2); stream one dock along v.
//
// DERIVED BEFORE THE GATE RUN (continuum, G = 1 / (24 D), 4 pi G = pi / (6 D)).
// 1. JEANS. Linearized about a uniform content n0: d^2 n / dt^2 = -c_s^2 k^2 n + Omega_J^2 n, Omega_J^2 = 4 pi G n0 =
//    pi n0 / (6 D). The marginal wavenumber is k_J = Omega_J / c_s = sqrt(pi n0 / (3 D)), lambda_J = sqrt(12 pi D / n0)
//    docks. The marginal point is a static balance, so it is the same in both closures. With the 1/r depth (lambda ~ 6
//    k^2) a growing mode exists at every k < k_J for any n0 > 0: the kill can fire only if the depth is screened.
// 2. THE GATE POINT: D = 16, n0 = 0.5 a dock (love 0.25, fear 0.25): Omega_J^2 = 0.016362, Omega_J = 0.12791 a beat,
//    k_J = 0.18090, lambda_J = 34.73 docks. On a ring of 256 docks the modes m = 1 .. 7 grow (k_7 = 0.1718) and m >= 8 do
//    not (k_8 = 0.1963). The lattice symbols (sin k, 12 (1 - cos k), the D1Q3 streaming) move k_J by order k^2 / 12, under
//    0.5%.
// 3. GROWTH. KNIT: gamma^2 + nu k^2 gamma = Omega_J^2 - c_s^2 k^2, so at m = 1 (k = 0.024544) gamma = 0.12659 a beat
//    (e-folding 7.9 beats). REGISTER (overdamped): gamma = (1/w - 1/2)(Omega_J^2 - c_s^2 k^2) = 0.938 x 0.016061 =
//    0.01507 a beat, slower by the relaxation, with the same marginal k.
// 4. THE CHARGE MODE. A love - fear wave carries no content, sources no depth and does not grow; the growing eigenvector
//    is pure content.
// 5. A SCREENED DEPTH (the control). E-GRV-0094's open husk screens the pull to a Yukawa of length 1.03 docks: lambda ->
//    lambda + 6 mu^2, mu = 1 / 1.03. Then Omega_J^2 k^2 / (k^2 + mu^2) against c_s^2 k^2 gives growth only for k^2 + mu^2
//    < k_J^2, so only above a content n_c = 3 D mu^2 / pi = 14.4 a dock (continuum): at n0 = 0.5 no wavelength grows.
//
// PROBES BEFORE THE GATES, disclosed. tmp/jn-probe1.ts (.log), written after the gates below and moving none of them:
//  every code path on a small plan (ring 64, 30 beats, the fit over beats 15 to 30, the stable wave at m 6), to find
//  coding errors. It found one (the map's start was scaled by 2 against the ring's; fixed) and then read: the largest
//  growing k 0.18041 in both closures against k_J 0.18090; at m 1 of 64 (k 0.0982) knit 0.10519 against the derived
//  0.10520, register 0.01066 against 0.01083; the ring against the map 1.4e-6 and 4.5e-7; the knit's late slope 0.985 of
//  the map's rate over beats 15 to 30, where the decaying branch has not died (the gate plan fits over 40 to 80); counts
//  kept to 2e-16; charge share 2e-32; the screened and the field-off maps grow nowhere; the m 6 wave at 0.084 of its
//  start; reads lambda_J 11.50 and 6.64 docks at n0 4.8 and 16 (continuum 11.21, 6.14), the screened lattice threshold
//  14.4018 (continuum 14.4018).
//
// HYPOTHESES AND GATES, fixed before the gate run.
//  H1 (the route): in both closures the one-beat map has a growing mode (|lambda| > 1) at some k; the largest growing k
//     (bisected on the map) is within 2% of the continuum k_J = 0.18090; the knit closure's growth rate at m = 1 is
//     within 2% of 0.12659 and the register closure's within 10% of 0.01507 (the overdamped form is approximate).
//  P1 (the falsifier, the route's kill): no k in (0, pi] has a growing mode, in either closure. PREDICTED: does not fire.
//  I1 (instrument): the ring run (256 docks, a content wave of relative amplitude 1e-9 at m = 1, 80 beats) equals the
//     map's prediction M(k)^80 applied to the start within 1e-4 (relative); the late growth rate fitted over beats 40 to
//     80 equals ln max |lambda(k)| within 1e-3 (relative); the love and fear counts are kept to 1e-12 (relative); the
//     growing eigenvector's charge share is under 1e-10.
//  C1 (control: the instrument reads the kill's outcome): the screened depth at n0 = 0.5 has no growing mode at any k
//     (max |lambda| <= 1 + 1e-12 on 4096 k in (0, pi]), in both closures; and with the depth off, none either.
//  C2 (control: the run reads a stable wave): the m = 12 wave (k = 0.2945 > k_J) run 80 beats in the knit closure stays
//     within its start amplitude (|amplitude| <= 1.0 of the start at beat 80, to the map's prediction within 1e-4).
//  READ, gating nothing: lambda_J and Omega_J at n0 = 4.8 (the flip knit's fill 0.2, 24 slots) and 16 (occupation 2/3);
//  the screened depth's lattice threshold n_c (bisected on the map) and its growing window at n0 = 16; the growth rates
//  at m = 1 .. 7.
// VERDICT: pass if H1 holds, P1 does not fire, and I1, C1, C2 hold; partial if H1's growth exists but a rate or k_J
//  gate misses, or an instrument or control fails; fail if P1 fires.
//
// FIRST RUN 2026-10-02 (tmp/jn-run1.log, 8 s): PASS, every gate as written, none moved or rerun.
//  - H1: both closures have growing modes; the largest growing k is 0.18041 in both (lambda_J 34.83 docks) against the
//    continuum 0.18090 (34.73), 0.27% short, the lattice's share. At m 1 (k 0.02454, 256 docks) the knit closure grows
//    0.12651 a beat against the derived 0.12659 (an e-fold in 7.9 beats), the register closure 0.01485 against the
//    overdamped 0.01507 (1.4% under, the relaxation's finite rate). Modes m 1 .. 7 grow (knit 0.1265 down to 0.0329,
//    register 0.0149 down to 0.0014), m 8 does not. P1 does not fire.
//  - I1: the ring runs equal the map's prediction to 7.3e-6 and 5.1e-6 (the 1e-9 start grows to 2.5e-5 in the knit
//    closure, so this is the nonlinearity), late slopes 1.00000 of the map's rate, counts kept to 2e-16, the growing mode's
//    charge share 1e-31: it is pure content, as derived. C1: the screened depth grows nowhere at n0 0.5 (largest |lambda|
//    1 - 1e-16 and 1 - 2.7e-7), nor does the field off. C2: the m 12 wave ends at 0.162 of its start (map gap 1.6e-5).
//  - Reads: lambda_J 11.50 docks at n0 4.8 (the flip knit's fill) and 6.64 at n0 16 (continuum 11.21, 6.14), with Omega_J
//    0.396 and 0.724 a beat: at the knit's own densities the Jeans length is a few docks. The screened depth (E-GRV-0094's
//    open husk) grows only above 14.4018 content a dock (continuum 14.4018), and at n0 16 only below k 0.289.
//
// WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT SHOW. It shows whether the coarse fluid made of the two densities and the depth field (as the
// ledger holds them: the depth register added, inertia a stand-in) has a Jeans instability, at which length, and how
// fast. It does not derive the coarse fluid from the rule (the closure is a single relaxation at the knit's viscosity),
// does not carry the radion's finite speed, and grows nothing nonlinear: no halo, no structure, only the linear
// instability that structure formation starts from. Its numbers are in docks and beats at D = 16.
//
// Depth L2 (a linear coarse model in floats, its map's eigenvalues and a ring run). DETERMINISM: no random numbers;
// placed waves. NOTHING MOVES on the rule: this is a coarse equation, not the rule.
