// RIPPLES FROM SHARED ANCESTRY (E-CSM-0061, OPEN-CSM-04, route I8b). Every husk dock the seed reaches shares a causal
// past with every other (E-CSM-0058). The route reads the fraction of shared ancestors against separation as the
// initial correlation function of the ripples (OPEN-MTH-05's exponent), and names its kill in advance: "the correlation
// is flat or exponential (no scale)".
//
// WHAT IS COUNTED. On the husk the seed's reach at beat tau is exactly the cubic l1 ball of radius tau (E-CSM-0058,
// 0059). A dock x reached at beat t has as ancestors every event (tau, y) with |y|_1 <= tau (y was reached at tau) and
// |x - y|_1 <= t - tau (y lies in x's past cone). For two docks x, x' at beat t the shared fraction is
// f = |A cap A'| / sqrt(|A| |A'|). The pairs are placed symmetrically about the seed on one husk axis, x = -d/2, x' =
// +d/2, d even, so |A| = |A'|.
//
// DERIVED BEFORE THE GATE RUN.
// 1. THE CONE'S SIZE. For x at the seed, |A| = sum over tau of b(min(tau, t - tau)), b(r) = (2r + 1)(2r^2 + 2r + 3) / 3
//    the l1 ball (41 at t = 4).
// 2. A SCALE IS BUILT IN. The only lengths are the lattice step and the reach t, so for d >> 1 the fraction is a
//    function of d / t: self-similar in the horizon, not a power of d alone. At d = 2t the cones meet only near the
//    segment through the seed, so f(2t) falls about as 1 / t: every pair keeps the seed in common, and little else.
//
// PROBE BEFORE THE GATES, DISCLOSED (scratchpad anc.py, Python, seconds): t = 4, 8, 12 with cone sizes 41, 321, 1289;
//  f at d = 0, 2, 4, ... 2t: t = 8 1, 0.686, 0.506, 0.367, 0.291, 0.211, 0.177, 0.125, 0.111; t = 12 1, 0.758, 0.596,
//  0.469, 0.384, 0.304, 0.254, 0.199, 0.170, 0.129, 0.114, 0.083, 0.077. So P1 and P2 below were seen at t <= 12; the
//  gates read t = 16 and 24, which the probe did not.
//
// HYPOTHESES AND GATES, fixed before the gate run, never moved.
//  I1 INSTRUMENT: |A| for x at the seed equals point 1's sum at every t read; the symmetric pair's cones have equal size.
//  H1 THE ROUTE (a scale-free spectrum): at t = 24 the local log-log slope of f against d is one constant over d = 6 to
//     24 (every local slope within 10 percent of their mean).
//  P1 THE HORIZON SCALE (point 2): f_16(d) and f_24(1.5 d) agree within 0.04 at d = 4, 8, 12, 16 (a function of d / t).
//  P2 THE EDGE (point 2): t f_t(2t) lies in [0.6, 1.2] at t = 16 and 24.
//  K THE ROUTE'S KILL, as written: the correlation is flat (f(t) > 0.9) or exponential (ln f linear in d over d = 2 to
//     2t at t = 24, every local decay rate within 10 percent of their mean).
// VERDICT, fixed before the run: PASS when I1 holds, K does not fire and H1 holds; FAIL when K fires; otherwise PARTIAL
//  (a scale is present, the route's power law is not), with P1 and P2 saying which scale.
// WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT SHOW. It counts causal pasts on the seed's husk reach; nothing of the rule runs, and
//  "shared ancestry is the ripple correlation" stays the route's reading.
//
// FIRST RUN 2026-10-02 (tmp/sa-csm-run1.log, 0.2 s): PARTIAL, as the verdict rule reads it, every gate as registered.
//  I1 holds (cone sizes 41, 321, 1289, ... equal to point 1's sum). K does not fire: f is not flat (0.448 at d = t = 24)
//  and not exponential (decay rates 0.020 to 0.141 a dock). H1 fails: the local log-log slopes run -0.44 to -1.34 over d =
//  6 to 24. P1 holds: f_16(d) and f_24(1.5 d) agree within 0.011 to 0.017. P2 holds: t f(2t) = 0.941 and 0.960. At t = 24
//  f reads 1, 0.858, 0.745, 0.650, 0.573, 0.504, 0.448, ... 0.040 at d = 2, 4, ... 48. So the correlation has a scale, and
//  the scale is the horizon: a function of d / t, not a power of d.
//
// Depth L1: exact counts.
// DETERMINISM: fixed geometry; no start, no random number.
