// The past hypothesis read on the ledger's own coarse map: is the seed the lowest coarse entropy among starts of its
// size, and does a growing region renew low entropy at its frontier? (E-FND-0174; routes I9a and I9b of
// roadmap/routes/gravity-cosmos-heat-classical.md, "the low-entropy start", OPEN-CSM-08.)
//
// WHAT IS RUN.
//  Part A (I9a, the main hypothesis). The coarse map is E-FND-0146's, unchanged (code/measure/second-law-husk): the husk
//  cut into blocks of b x b x b columns, E_b the knit's conserved energy (held slots + 2 per stored unit) in block b,
//  H = - sum p_b ln p_b with p_b = E_b / E. The box is the side-4 D4 box of the adopted knit (256 docks, 64 husk
//  columns of 4 docks), cut into 8 blocks of 2 x 2 x 2 columns (32 docks each). The seed is the start of E-CSM-0058 and
//  E-CSM-0059: one distinction, the base dock, on a background written by growth. E-FND-0168 found that the knit's own
//  calm writes the EMPTY mesh (no vibe, no store), so the seed's world is the empty box with one dock distinct. The
//  SIZE of a start is the number of docks that differ from the background; a start of the seed's size differs on one
//  dock. Enumerated: every dock (256) and every content a dock can hold as the coarse map reads it, k held slots
//  (0 to 24) and j stored units (0 to 12), not both 0: 256 x 324 = 82,944 starts, each built as a state and read by
//  the instrument itself. Which slots and which role points are held does not enter E_b, so these are every coarse
//  state a one-dock start can reach. The seed itself is read in two forms: one held slot at the origin dock (the least
//  distinction) and the full origin dock (24 held slots and 12 stored units, the seed E-FND-0168's runs C use).
//  The same question is then put on the adopted coset-union vacuum (E-RLT-0093), where the seed is not the beginning:
//  every one-dock change of it that adds held slots, sets store trits on free lines or clears stored ones
//  (236,544 starts; a sign flip of a stored unit, delta = 0, is not enumerated).
//  Part B (I9b, the second hypothesis). The register rule under register growth (code/measure/register-growth,
//  E-FND-0168: the plain wake, the reflecting frontier, a born dock written in chi = EMPTY, the light unit
//  ringUnit(-1, 4)), the seed a full dock at the origin (192 member orbitals), on the tori L = 4 (128 docks, wake shells
//  1, 24, 74, 28, 1) and L = 6 (648 docks, 7 shells). The dock's coarse entropy is its occupation entropy in the
//  register's own modes, S_x = sum over the dock's 192 modes of h(n_m), h the binary entropy and n_m the mode's
//  occupation (the diagonal of the Slater state's one-body density, valid because the orbitals stay orthonormal). A dock
//  in one Fock state reads exactly 0: chi (every n_m = 0) and the full seed dock (every n_m = 1). This is the "zero-
//  entropy dock state" of the route. Read at every row t (the state after beats 0 to t - 1, so the docks with birth
//  beat at most t - 1 are born), grouped by birth beat. Beside it: the same seed in a region already born at beat 0
//  (every dock born, chi everywhere, the "preborn" run), and on L = 4 a slow wake (a shell every 2 beats).
//
// DERIVED BEFORE THE GATE RUN.
//  1. On any partition into blocks, H >= 0, and H = 0 exactly when one block holds all the energy. A start that differs
//     from the empty background on one dock puts all its energy in that dock's block. So every one-dock start on the
//     empty mesh reads H = 0 exactly, whatever the dock holds and wherever it is. The seed sits at the floor, and so
//     does every start of its size: the route's kill (a start of the same size strictly lower) cannot fire on this
//     coarse map. What the enumeration adds is the exact confirmation; what the derivation adds is the scope: the seed's
//     minimality is not special to the seed. It holds for every start of its size, and for every start of any size
//     confined to one block.
//  2. On the coset-union vacuum of the side-4 box every block holds the same energy (192, read in probe 1: H = ln 8),
//     so a one-dock change with energy change delta gives one block 192 + delta and the rest 192, and H depends on
//     delta alone, not on which dock. The deficit ln 8 - H grows with |delta| (at second order (B - 1) delta^2 / (2 (B a +
//     delta)^2) with a = 192; computed exactly: 1.48e-6 at delta = +1, 5.90e-6 at +2, 5.97e-6 at -2).
//     A dock holds at most 24 held slots and 12 stored units (energy 48). The vacuum's docks hold 4 stored units (192
//     docks) or none (64 docks) (probe 3), so delta runs from -8 to +40 on a stored dock and from 0 to +48 on a
//     store-free dock. The lowest H of a one-dock start on the vacuum is therefore delta = +48, the full dock on a
//     store-free dock, 64 starts; the origin dock holds 4 stored units (probe 4), so the full dock at the origin is
//     delta = +40 and is NOT minimal there. On the vacuum, minimality is a property of the dock's background, not of
//     the seed.
//  3. Under the plain wake the seed's full dock is invariant at beat 0 (all its neighbors are unborn, so the reflecting
//     stream maps the dock to itself, and a full dock's span is fixed by any dock-local unitary). So growth from a full
//     seed is the preborn run shifted by one beat. The two runs apply the pieces in opposite order after that (Q_D first
//     against Q_S first); that the occupations still agree was measured in probe 5 at L = 4 (4e-15), not derived. If it
//     holds at L = 6 too, the frontier's renewal is exactly what an empty region already present around the seed would
//     give: the birth beat equals the graph distance from the seed, and the frontier is the edge of the seed's light
//     cone.
//
// PROBES BEFORE THE GATES, disclosed (tmp/se-probe1 to se-probe5; no gate was moved after the gate run).
//  se-probe1: the instrument on the knit at sides 4 and 8. The coset-union vacuum reads H = ln B exactly with equal
//   blocks (192 per block at side 4, 3,072 at side 8 with 8 blocks). A full-dock seed on the empty mesh, run 200 beats:
//   H = 0 at beat 0, 1.12 to 1.66 at beat 1, then it fluctuates and returns to exactly 0 again and again (the free
//   stream refocuses the few vibes); its mean over beats 101 to 200 is 1.39 to 1.52 against ln 8 = 2.08. Energy exact.
//  se-probe2: Part B at L = 4 for 12 rows (plain, slow, preborn): the shells' mean S per row; the plain run equals the
//   preborn run one row later to the printed digits; the newest born shell had the lowest mean at rows 3 to 8 and not at
//   row 9 (0.678 against 0.343). 192 members kept (2.6e-13), Gram gap 2.7e-15.
//  se-probe3, se-probe4: the vacuum's per-dock store counts (4 on 192 docks, 0 on 64) and the origin dock's (4).
//  se-probe5: the plain run's mode occupations at row t + 1 against the preborn run's at row t, L = 4, t = 0 to 9:
//   largest difference 4.0e-15.
//  So H4, C2 and R at L = 4 are confirmations of probes; at L = 6 they are predictions. H2 was derived after probes 3
//  and 4. H1 and C1 are derivations (1), confirmed by enumeration here.
//
// HYPOTHESES AND GATES, fixed before the gate run.
//  I1 instrument: on the side-4 box, blockEnergy summed equals energyOf on every start read in Part A, and the
//     vacuum reads H = ln 8 within 1e-15.
//  C1 control (the comparison can return the kill): the 32,640 starts of two held slots on two different docks of the
//     empty side-4 box read H = 0 exactly on the 3,968 same-block pairs and |H - ln 2| <= 1e-15 on the other 28,672; so
//     against a split pair as the reference, 3,968 starts of the same size are strictly lower: the instrument and the
//     comparison read the other outcome when it exists.
//  H1 (route I9a) the seed is minimal: both forms of the seed read H = 0 exactly, and none of the 82,944 one-dock starts
//     on the empty box reads below it (every one reads exactly 0: all tie).
//  P1 (I9a's kill) some one-dock start reads H strictly below the seed's.
//  H2 (the vacuum reading): on the coset-union vacuum every one-dock start's H depends on delta alone (equal within
//     1e-14 for equal delta); the least H is attained exactly by the 64 starts with delta = +48; the full dock at the
//     origin (delta = +40) reads above it.
//  I2 instrument for Part B: at the end of each run the orbitals' Gram gap is at most 1e-12 and the member weight is
//     192 within 1e-8; at every row every unborn dock reads S = 0 exactly; the seed reads S = 0 at row 0.
//  H3 (route I9b) entropy depends on birth beat: on the plain wake at L = 4 and L = 6, at every row t from 3 to T, the
//     born shells' mean S spans more than 1e-3 (largest minus least).
//  P2 (I9b's kill) at some L, at every row 3 to T, the born shells' mean S agree within 1e-6.
//  H4 the arrow points away from the frontier while the region grows: at every row t from 3 to last + 1 (the rows at
//     which the newest born shell is the one born at beat t - 1), the newest born shell has the least mean S among the
//     born shells, at L = 4 and L = 6.
//  C2 control for H4 (the reading can come out the other way): at some row from last + 2 to T the last shell does NOT
//     have the least mean S, at L = 4 and L = 6.
//  R  the renewal is the seed's light cone: the plain run's mode occupations at row t + 1 equal the preborn run's at
//     row t within 1e-12 for t = 0 to T - 1, at L = 4 and L = 6.
//  Rows: T = 12 at L = 4, T = 10 at L = 6.
//
// VERDICT rule: pass if every gate holds; fail if P1 or P2 fires (H1 or H3 fails); partial if I1, C1 or I2 fails, or
// if H2, H4, C2 or R misses while H1 and H3 hold.
//
// Reported, not gated: the full-dock seed on the empty side-4 box run 200 beats forward and 200 back (H at beats 1 to
// 4, the beats with H exactly 0, the late mean against ln 8); the per-row shell means; the slow wake at L = 4 (rows at
// which its newest born shell has the least mean S).
//
// WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT SHOW. It can show whether, on the coarse map the arrow experiments use (E-FND-0146,
// E-FND-0155), anything of the seed's size starts lower than the seed, and whether a grown region's coarse entropy
// depends on birth beat. It cannot show that the seed is singled out: on the empty mesh minimality is a tie shared by
// every start of its size (derivation 1), so this map does not choose the seed among them. It does not read a coarse
// map other than block energy (Part A) and dock occupation (Part B); a finer map with blocks of one dock would tie in
// the same way. Part B uses the register rule's one-body pieces, not the knit; it says nothing about the knit under
// growth, which has no growth rule (E-FND-0168). I9c (the ceiling) and I9d (the depth field) are not read.
//
// FIRST RUN 2026-10-02 (tmp/se-run1.log, 165 s): PARTIAL, on C2 alone. Every other gate held. Recorded as is.
//  - I1, C1: the vacuum reads ln 8 exactly. Of the 32,640 two-dock pairs, 3,968 read 0 (same block) and 28,672 read
//    ln 2, as derived.
//  - H1 held and P1 did not fire: all 82,944 one-dock starts on the empty box read H = 0 exactly, both seeds too, and
//    none read below the seed. The minimality is a tie with every start of the seed's size, as derivation 1 says it
//    must be.
//  - H2 held: on the vacuum the deficit depends on delta alone. It runs from 1.48e-6 (delta 1) to 3.04e-3 (delta +48,
//    the 64 full docks on store-free docks). The full origin dock (delta +40) reads 2.15e-3, so it is not minimal there.
//  - I2, H3, H4 and R held at L = 4 and L = 6. Gram gap at most 1.3e-13, member drift at most 7.9e-10. The born
//    shells' mean occupation entropy spans at least 2.67 (L = 4) and 4.64 (L = 6) at every row from 3 on (the seed dock
//    swings between about 0.6 and 82 on alternate rows). The newest born shell is the least while the region grows.
//    The grown run equals the preborn run one row later to 4.2e-15 and 5.0e-15.
//  - C2 missed at L = 6: after the last shell is born (rows 8 to 10) it stays the least (0.000 to 0.001 against 0.008
//    to 0.014 for the shell before it), so in 10 rows the reading never came out the other way there. At L = 4 it did
//    (rows 9 and 11: 0.678 against 0.343, 1.829 against 0.404). The L = 6 window was 3 rows. The reading may only need
//    longer, which this run does not show.
//  - Reported: the full-dock seed (24 held, 12 stored) on the empty side-4 box read 1.12, 1.92, 1.93, 1.39 at beats 1
//    to 4 and did NOT return to H = 0 in 200 beats (late mean 0.698 of ln 8). Forward and backward gave the same
//    numbers. The probe 1 sentence above, "returns to exactly 0 again and again", holds for the seed without stores and
//    at side 8. With stores at side 4, probe 1 had already read a late minimum of 0.173. The header overstated it. It
//    is corrected here, not rerun. The slow wake at L = 4 had the newest shell least at rows 4 to 9 and 11.
//  Reading: I9a's kill does not fire, but the seed is not singled out: on block energy every start of its size ties
//  at the floor. I9b's kill does not fire either, but on the plain wake with chi empty the birth-beat dependence is
//  exactly the seed's light cone in an empty region that is already there. The frontier adds empty docks, not a new
//  low-entropy source. Title written after the run.
//
// Depth L2: an exact enumeration (Part A, integer energies, H exact at 0) and float amplitudes with reported
// residuals (Part B). DETERMINISM: no random numbers; role points from the silver sequence; every orbital a fixed local
// basis vector. NOTHING MOVES: the stream copies.
