// THE DEPTH FROM GAUSS'S LAW ON THE WARPED COLUMN (E-FRC-0281, OPEN-FND-04, OPEN-LGT-04). Two counts are still
// chosen, the depth D and the light's split (roadmap Q "no free parameters"). Solutions section 7's second
// candidate, "D from the cusp", says the warp fixes the column depth: Gauss's law exact on the warped column forces
// one D. Two routes rows carry it: routes/mind-whole-engine-techniques.md (row "D from Gauss on the warped column":
// the Gauss residual on the warped column over D = 1 to 64, killed if exact at every D or at none) and
// routes/matter-forces-numbers.md (row "D from the cusp": Gauss's law on the warped column at D = 5 to 12, killed if
// every D satisfies it). E-FRC-0261 found that one light speed fixes only kappa against the register size and D never
// enters it, so a condition that fixes D has to come from somewhere else; this is one candidate.
//
// WHAT "THE WARPED COLUMN" IS IN THE CODE. The column is code/rule/trit-column's (E-FRC-0207): the D4 bulk with husk
// period L on x1, x2, x3 and period 2D on the depth x4, so each husk dock has a column of D bulk docks, levels
// m = 0 .. D - 1, each holding trits; the husk reads column sums. Gauss's law in the bulk holds by construction (the
// flux is the string minus the curl of the triangle potentials), and the husk's Gauss's law is the husk divergence
// of the column-summed flux against the column-summed charge (trit-column huskGaussViolations, held at D 4, 8, 16 in
// E-FRC-0207). The only code that warps a column is code/measure/photon-husk warpWeights (E-FRC-0177): a bulk link
// weighs lambda^(-s j) at the shallower of its two docks, j the dock's layer, lambda = 18.2787 the {3,4,3,4} warp
// factor (the largest root of lambda^3 - 21 lambda^2 + 51 lambda - 23, E-MTH-0007), s = 1/3 (a shell's linear size)
// or s = 1 (its share of the ball). There the layer is read both ways from the sheet, j = min(m, L - m), on the
// isotropic box where D = L, and E-FRC-0177 compared the warped divergence with the unweighted column charge. Here
// the same weights are put on the trit column with D free. "Gauss's law on the warped column at depth D" is then:
// for every bulk field of the rule's form, the husk divergence of the warped projection equals the column charge,
// read either weighted (each dock's charge times its own layer weight) or unweighted (E-FRC-0177's reading).
// Two layerings are run: two-sided, j = min(m, D - m) (E-FRC-0177's), and one-sided, j = m (a column with a top
// and a bottom). E-GRV-0102's warp (the bulk clock warped with the scale) acts on a scalar gravity stack's inertia
// only and does not enter a Gauss constraint, so it is not a reading of this question.
//
// DERIVED BEFORE THE GATE RUN.
// 1. NO LINK STAYS IN A COLUMN. Every D4 root has two nonzero coordinates, so none lies along the depth alone, and
//    every bulk link joins two columns. A link with no depth part keeps its level; a link along e_i + e4 or
//    e_i - e4 joins level m to level m or m - 1 (the column's x4 parity flips), and the level D - 1 to level 0
//    across the period. So the levels of every column form one chain, 0 - 1 - ... - (D - 1) - 0, through links.
// 2. THE THEOREM. Let a link l from dock x (column c) to dock y (column c') weigh w_l, and let the husk charge
//    read dock weights phi. The husk divergence at c takes +w_l E_l from l, the weighted charge at c takes
//    phi_x E_l from l (since q = div E), and likewise -w_l E_l against -phi_y E_l at c'. The two agree for every
//    field E exactly when phi_x = phi_y = w_l on every link. With weights that depend on the level only, that
//    forces one value along each chain of point 1, so the only weightings that keep Gauss's law exactly are the
//    constant ones. For lambda^(-s j) with s > 0 (injective in j) the residual vanishes identically exactly when no
//    link joins two different layers, which happens only when the column has a single layer: D = 1, where every
//    weight is lambda^0 = 1 and the warp has nothing to act on. For the unweighted charge reading the weights
//    must all be 1: again only D = 1. At every D >= 2 Gauss's law fails, and the failure does not depend on D.
//    So the warped projection is exact at D = 1 only, the column with no warp, and at no D >= 2; in 5 .. 12, at none.
// 3. THE WARP INSIDE THE RULE. If the warp is put into the constrained variable itself (the stored bulk flux is
//    F = w E and the rule's bulk Gauss's law is div F = q, as the gravity stacks of E-GRV-0100 to 0105 carry their
//    weights inside the rule), the column sum of F telescopes against the column sum of q at every D, by point 1's
//    no-link-in-a-column. That reading is exact at EVERY D. Either way D does not enter: Gauss's law is linear and
//    local, a column sum of bulk constraints, and the column's length is not in it.
// 4. D = 1 IS NOT A DEPTH THE WARP CHOOSES. It is the one value at which the column has one layer and no warp
//    exists. On E-FRC-0207's p = 1 trit light kappa = 2/(2D + 1) = 2/3 there, and with the husk's lambda_max = 16
//    kappa lambda_max = 32/3 > 4, outside the leapfrog's stable range (D >= 4 is needed); the adopted loop light runs
//    at kappa = 3/16 at every N (E-FRC-0260), so stability alone does not exclude it there. Its alpha at N = 3 and
//    rho = 0.4614 is 1/alpha = 36 sqrt(2 rho / 3) = 19.97, not 137.
// So the route is predicted to fail: the warped column keeps Gauss's law only where it is not warped.
//
// PROBES BEFORE THE GATES, DISCLOSED. tmp/dg-probe1.ts built the trit bulk at side 4 for D = 1, 2, 3, 64 (docks
// 64 .. 4,096, 768 .. 49,152 links, 49 to 1,087 ms each), to size the run. No residual was read before the gates.
//
// WHAT IS RUN. Side 4 (64 husk docks), every D = 1 .. 64. Two fields of the rule's own form, all trits: (a) a
// love-fear pair joined by a string of three links along e1 + e4 (love at level 0, fear at level 1 when D >= 2),
// with every triangle's potential trit set to floor(3 frac(n phi)) - 1 from the golden Weyl sequence (n the
// triangle's index plus 1); (b) the same potentials with no pair, a charge-free curl field. The flux is
// trit-column bulkFlux. Exact counts in integers; warped residuals in floats.
//
// HYPOTHESES AND GATES, fixed before the gate run, never moved.
//  I1 INSTRUMENT: at every D = 1 .. 64, both fields: every stored value in -1 .. 1, 0 bulk Gauss violations
//     (trit-column bulkGaussViolations), and the flat column sum (s = 0) has 0 husk Gauss violations computed in
//     integers by this file's projection, and the same count from trit-column huskGaussViolations on its
//     columnSumLinks. The theorem's input: every bulk link joins two different columns (0 links inside a column).
//  C1 CONTROL (the instrument reads a failure): the one-sheet restriction (only links whose two docks are both at
//     level 0, E-FRC-0207's control) has husk Gauss violations > 0 on field (a) at every D = 2 .. 64.
//  H1 THE ROUTE: some warped reading (s in {1/3, 1}, either layering, either charge reading) has 0 violating husk
//     docks on both fields at some D in 2 .. 64, and some D in 2 .. 64 where it does not. (D = 1 is left out: the
//     column there has one layer and the warp is not defined on it; it is reported below.)
//  P1 THE FALSIFIER (point 2): at every D = 2 .. 64, every warped reading has violating husk docks > 0 on field
//     (a), the number of links joining different layers is > 0 for both layerings, and the level graph of point 1
//     (levels joined when a link joins them) is connected, so no level weighting but a constant keeps Gauss's law.
//     In particular no D in 5 .. 12 is exact (the cusp row's window).
// REPORTED, not moving the status:
//  D1 at D = 1 every warped reading has 0 violations on both fields, exactly (all weights are 1), as derived.
//  R0 the smallest relative residual |r|_2 / |P_w E|_2 over D = 2 .. 64 for each warped reading on field (a),
//     predicted far above the float floor (above 1e-3): no D comes near exact.
//  W  the warp inside the rule (point 3, s = 1, two-sided): the column sum of F = w E against the column sum of
//     div F, relative residual under 1e-12 at every D = 1 .. 64.
// VERDICT, fixed before the run: FAIL (as derived) when I1, C1 and P1 hold (the route fixes no D); PASS when I1, C1
//  and H1 hold; PARTIAL otherwise.
// WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT SHOW. It decides the question as the code defines the warped column: E-FRC-0177's layer
//  weights on the trit column of E-FRC-0207, on the flat D4 box. It does not build the true hyperbolic column, whose
//  link count grows with depth (E-FRC-0177 notes it is not built); point 2's argument covers any weighting by level
//  and point 3 any warp carried inside the rule's constraint, but a column whose geometry changes the incidence
//  itself is outside both. A fail removes Gauss's law as the source of D on this column; it says nothing about the
//  other D-fixing candidates (a fixed point of the running, a seam condition).
//
// FIRST RUN 2026-10-02 (tmp/dg-run1.log, 84 s): FAIL, as derived; every gate as fixed, none moved. I1 holds: at
//  every D = 1 .. 64 all values are trits, 0 bulk Gauss violations, 0 flat husk violations on both fields by both
//  counts, 0 links inside a column. C1 holds: the one-sheet restriction violates the husk's Gauss's law at 49 to 59
//  of the 64 husk docks at every D >= 2 (0 at D = 1, where the sheet is the column). H1 fails and P1 holds: the
//  warped column is exact at 0 of D = 2 .. 64 and 0 of D = 5 .. 12 under every reading (s = 1/3 and 1, two-sided
//  and one-sided, weighted and unweighted charge); at s = 1 two-sided weighted, 62, 63 and then 64 of 64 husk docks
//  violate from D = 2 on; links joining two layers number 384 at D = 2 and 12,288 at D = 64 (two-sided, 192 per
//  layer step), and the level graph is one component at every D. Reported: D1 holds (every warped reading exactly
//  0 at D = 1, one layer, every weight 1). R0 holds: the smallest relative residual over D = 2 .. 64 is 0.16 (s = 1/3,
//  two-sided, at D = 37) to 0.28 (s = 1, one-sided, at D = 15), with no trend toward 0 (s = 1 two-sided: 0.50, 0.53,
//  0.58, 0.35 at D = 2 .. 5, 0.37 at 12, 0.35 at 64). W holds: the warp carried inside the rule keeps Gauss's law
//  at every D, worst 5.3e-16 relative. So the warp as a projection breaks Gauss's law at every depth that has a warp,
//  and the warp as part of the rule keeps it at every depth: D enters neither. Title written after the run.
//
// Depth L1: exact counts and an exact identity, with the warped residuals in floats beside them.
