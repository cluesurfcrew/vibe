// EMISSION SETS THE SHARE? (E-FRC-0288, OPEN-LGT-02; the route "emission sets the share" in roadmap/routes/mind-whole-
// engine-techniques.md, section "Q · no free parameters"). The light's split rho = f / s (the force's share over the
// drift's at fixed coupling kappa = s f) is undecided between the average reading 0.4613818 and the worst-register
// reading 0.4146386 (E-FRC-0269). For the free light the split is a constant change of units (E-FRC-0276): the beat at
// one split is the beat at the other conjugated by one fixed matrix, and the split moves only a mode's e / x share, by
// exactly rho1 / rho2 = 1.1127. The route: with matter coupled, the share the matter emits into is fixed by the
// member, not by units, so the split at which the emitted share and the vacuum's share agree is chosen by the coupled
// system. Its kill: the emitted share scales with rho exactly as the vacuum's does.
//
// WHAT IS RUN. A STAND-IN emitter, a harmonic oscillator of gap delta per beat (the single-excitation reading of a
// two-level member, exact for a harmonic one), coupled at one husk link (dock 0, axis 0) to the linear husk light on a
// side-12 husk torus (code/measure/emission-share; the light is E-FRC-0276's beat x <- x + s e, e <- e - f C^T N C W x
// in real space, 15,552 links and 34,560 triangles), kappa = 1/16 in G's units (kappa mu_max = 2, stable). The member
// starts excited, (q, p) = (0, 1), the light empty. How matter couples in the code:
//  - through the field E: the ladder's STAND-IN atom (code/rule/plaquette-ladder, E-FRC-0233) couples in the drift
//    phase zeta^(-c bal(x + R)^2), a complete square in the rung's field R whose strength g = 4 pi c / M carries the
//    drift exponent, so g is proportional to s. Here: the link's energy completed to (s w / 2)(e + gE q / (s w))^2,
//    H = gE q e + gE^2 q^2 / (2 s w), with gE split-free ("E fixed") or gE proportional to s ("E drift", the ladder's).
//  - through the potential A: the register member's covariant Clifford hop H = M beta + K alpha (OPEN-LGT-12,
//    E-SPN-0180) carries the link field as a phase on the hop, the Peierls coupling, whose charge (1/3) does not
//    depend on the split. Here: minimal coupling of the emitter, delta ((p - gA x)^2 + q^2) / 2, gA split-free
//    ("A fixed"). A bare gA p x without the A^2 term is unbounded below and runs away (probe 1).
//  - both at once with split-free weights ("mixed").
// Every coupling step is its own exact time-one flow (a shear), so the coupled beat is exactly symplectic.
//
// THE SHARE. As E-FRC-0269 reads a fill: sigma = (mean over links of e^2) / (mean over triangles of B^2), B = C W x,
// averaged over beats 200 to 399 of a 400-beat run, on the whole box and on the far field (docks beyond distance 3 of
// the emitter: the radiated light, without the emitter's bound near field). The emitted light's own balance is
// rho_em = rho / sigma, the split at which the emitted light would fill link and plaquette registers alike. The
// vacuum's share is sigma_vac = rho / rho_vac, rho_vac the vacuum's balance on the box's own momenta (E-FRC-0269's
// average, husk-balance averageFills). The route's agreement is sigma = sigma_vac, that is rho_em = rho_vac. The
// departure read at the two splits is D = (sigma(rho1) / sigma(rho2)) / (rho1 / rho2) - 1: D = 0 is the kill.
//
// DERIVED BEFORE THE GATE RUN.
//  1. THE COUPLED UNIT CHANGE. With x = sqrt(s) a and e = b / sqrt(s) (a canonical change: (x, W e) to (a, W b)) the
//     light's energy is kappa-only. The E coupling becomes (gE / sqrt s) q b + (gE / sqrt s)^2 q^2 / (2 w) and the A
//     coupling delta ((p - gA sqrt(s) a)^2 + q^2) / 2: each keeps its form, with its strength rescaled. So the coupled
//     beat at rho1 with (gE, gA) equals diag(1, M) times the coupled beat at rho2 with (gE sqrt(s2 / s1), gA sqrt(s1 /
//     s2)) times diag(1, M)^-1, M = diag(sqrt(s1 / s2), sqrt(s2 / s1)) on (x, e), exactly, at every beat. The same
//     holds for the quantum light: the change is a squeeze that maps the light's vacuum at fixed kappa to itself.
//  2. ONE FIELD ONLY: CARRIED ALONG. A coupling through E alone or A alone is, at the other split, the same coupling
//     with a different strength (canonical strength gE / sqrt s, or gA sqrt s). At first order in the strength the
//     emitted light is that strength times a response with no rho in it, and sigma, a ratio of two quadratics, is rho
//     times a rho-free number: D = 0 at first order, BY THEOREM, for every member. What is left is the strength's
//     change between the splits (canonical strength squared moves by s2 / s1 = 1.0549 for E fixed, by s1 / s2 for A
//     fixed and E drift), which enters only through the member's back-reaction (decay, level shift): D = O(g^2), of
//     opposite sign for E fixed and E drift. A coupling written in the rescaled units (gE proportional to sqrt s, or
//     gA to 1 / sqrt s) has one canonical strength at both splits, so D = 0 at every order, at every beat: the brief's
//     control.
//  3. TWO FIELDS: NOT CARRIED. A coupling through E and A with split-free weights changes its canonical E / A mix by
//     s1 / s2 = 0.948 between the splits, so its first-order response is not one rho-free response and D need not
//     vanish as g -> 0. But a free mode of frequency omega shares its fill as the free light does (E-FRC-0276), so the
//     radiated part (the far field) can depart only through the spectrum it is emitted into, which the gap fixes; the
//     near field, bound to the member, can depart at first order.
//  4. SO THE ROUTE DIES BY THEOREM for every single-field coupling, and both couplings the code has (the ladder's
//     drift-phase dipole, the Clifford hop's Peierls phase) are single-field: at the two splits the emitted share
//     moves by rho1 / rho2 as the vacuum's does, up to an O(g^2) term that is a change of coupling strength, not an
//     agreement. The agreement rho_em = rho_vac then holds at both splits or at neither: it is a condition on the
//     member (its gap), not on the split.
// PREDICTED: the kill fires (D = O(g^2) for E fixed, E drift, A fixed; D at roundoff for the rescaled control).
//
// PROBES BEFORE THE GATES (disclosed; tmp/em-probe1.ts to em-probe3.ts, with logs em-probe2.log, em-probe3.log).
//  - Probe 1 (side 12, 200 beats): a bare A coupling gA p x ran away (emitter energy 3e7): the gauge line of x has no
//    stiffness, so the A^2 term is required; the bare E coupling (no self-energy) gave departures of 1e-3 to 4e-2 that
//    did not fall with g, from its order-g^2 level shift (gE^2 f K_ll / w, a few percent of delta) dephasing the two
//    splits over the run. Both couplings were then written as complete squares (above).
//  - Probe 2 (400 beats, delta = 0.5, g = 0.2 to 0.025), with the complete squares: E fixed D (whole, far) = -4.6e-4,
//    -9.1e-5 at g = 0.05 and -1.2e-4, -2.3e-5 at 0.025 (each a quarter); A fixed 2.3e-5, 1.0e-5 and 6.0e-6, 2.5e-6;
//    E drift the mirror of E fixed; the rescaled control at 1e-12; mixed whole 1.8e-3 and 2.1e-3 (not falling), far
//    -1.1e-4 and -5.6e-5.
//  - Probe 3: the far-field rho_em at rho1, E fixed g = 0.05: 0.495, 0.493, 0.486, 0.465, 0.385, 0.406 at delta =
//    0.25, 0.5, 0.6, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25; the vacuum balance on the side-12 box's momenta 0.4613753 (0.4613818 on the
//    midpoint grids).
//
// HYPOTHESES AND GATES, fixed before the gate run (delta = 0.5 unless stated; g = 0.1, 0.05, 0.025).
//  I1 THE INSTRUMENT, THE CONJUGATION: for E fixed, A fixed and mixed at g = 0.05, the run at rho1 and the run at rho2
//     with (gE sqrt(s2 / s1), gA sqrt(s1 / s2)) agree through diag(1, M): max |x1 - sqrt(s1 / s2) x2| / max |x1| and
//     the same for e are <= 1e-9, and the emitters' final energies agree to 1e-9.
//  I2 EMISSION HAPPENS: at g = 0.1 the emitter's final energy is at most 0.9 of its start for E fixed, A fixed and
//     mixed, at both splits.
//  C0 THE BRIEF'S CONTROL (a coupling in the rescaled units: gE = g sqrt(s / s1), and gA = g sqrt(s1 / s)): |D| <=
//     1e-10, whole and far, at every g.
//  C1 THE INSTRUMENT READS THE OTHER OUTCOME: a member whose gap moves with the split (E rescaled, g = 0.05, delta =
//     0.5 at rho1 and 0.75 at rho2): |D_far| >= 1e-2.
//  H1 THE ROUTE: for some single-field split-free coupling (E fixed, E drift, A fixed) the share does not follow rho:
//     |D| >= 1e-3 at g = 0.025 (whole or far), or |D(0.025)| > 0.5 |D(0.05)| with |D(0.05)| >= 1e-6.
//  P1 THE FALSIFIER (the kill): for E fixed, E drift and A fixed, |D| <= 2e-3 at every g, whole and far, and it falls
//     as g^2: |D(0.025)| <= 0.35 |D(0.05)| (or both below 1e-9), whole and far; and for mixed, |D_far| <= 2e-3 at
//     every g.
//  M1 REPORTED, NOT IN THE VERDICT (item 3): mixed's whole-box D does not fall as g^2 (|D(0.025)| > 0.35 |D(0.05)|).
// READ: rho_em (far) at both splits over the gaps delta = 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25 (E fixed, g = 0.05), and where it
// meets 0.4614 and 0.4146 (linear interpolation in delta): the gap at which the emitted light balances as each
// candidate does.
// VERDICT, fixed before the gate run: FAIL (as derived, the route killed) when I1, I2, C0, C1 and P1 hold; PASS when
// I1, I2, C0, C1 and H1 hold and P1 does not; PARTIAL otherwise (an instrument or control gate failing, or neither
// H1 nor P1 holding).
//
// WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT SHOW. It can show that on the linear husk light no coupling through one field moves the
// emitted share off rho's own scaling, which is what the kill names, and it reads the size of the strength term. It
// cannot speak for the integer rule: there the registers have a capacity and a seam, a change of units does not map
// integers to integers, and the split is a statement about where a register wraps (E-FRC-0269, E-FRC-0286), which no
// linear reading touches. The emitter is a STAND-IN (a harmonic oscillator on one link), not the register member, so
// the member's own gap, and with it its rho_em, is not read. Depth L2: float dynamics, residuals reported.
//
// DETERMINISM: no random numbers; every run starts from the same state.
//
// FIRST RUN 2026-10-02 (tmp/em-run1.log, 26 s): FAIL, as derived. Every instrument and control gate held, P1 held and
// H1 did not; no gate moved and none was rerun.
//  - I1: the run at rho1 and the conjugated run at rho2 with the rescaled strengths agree to 2.3e-13 (x, e and the
//    emitter, E fixed, A fixed and mixed): the coupled split is a change of units that carries the coupling's strength.
//  - I2: at g = 0.1 the emitter keeps 0.306 / 0.311 (E fixed), 0.430 / 0.427 (A fixed), 0.266 / 0.267 (mixed) of 0.5.
//  - C0: the couplings written in the rescaled units give |D| <= 8.1e-13. C1: a gap moved from 0.5 to 0.75 with the
//    split reads D_far = -5.7e-2, so the instrument reads a share the member moves.
//  - P1 (the kill): D for E fixed, E drift, A fixed is at most 1.6e-3 (whole, g = 0.1) and falls as g^2: at g = 0.05 and
//    0.025, E fixed -4.6e-4 and -1.2e-4 whole, -9.1e-5 and -2.3e-5 far; E drift the mirror (+4.8e-4, +1.2e-4); A fixed
//    2.3e-5 and 6.0e-6 whole, 1.0e-5 and 2.5e-6 far; largest ratio D(0.025) / D(0.05) 0.261. Mixed far |D| <= 1.5e-4.
//  - M1 (reported): the mixed coupling's whole-box D does not fall (9.6e-4, 1.8e-3, 2.1e-3 at g = 0.1, 0.05, 0.025),
//    as item 3 says: two fields with split-free weights are not carried, and the departure lives in the bound near
//    field; the radiated far field falls with g (1.5e-4 to 5.6e-5).
//  - READ: the far-field emitted balance rho_em is the same at both splits to 4e-4 at every gap: 0.4953, 0.4928, 0.4645,
//    0.3846, 0.4056 at delta = 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25 (vacuum balance on the box 0.4613753). It meets 0.4614 at
//    delta 0.760 and 0.4146 at delta 0.906: the agreement rho_em = rho_vac picks the member's gap, not the split.
// WHAT IT MEANS for OPEN-LGT-02: emission cannot choose the split on the linear light. Every coupling the code has goes
// through one field (the ladder's drift-phase dipole through E, the Clifford hop's Peierls phase through A), and the
// unit change carries it, so the emitted share moves by rho1 / rho2 as the vacuum's does; the coupling's strength
// moves too (its square by 1.055), which changes the rate and leaves an O(g^2) trace, not an agreement. The split stays
// a question about the registers' integer seams.
