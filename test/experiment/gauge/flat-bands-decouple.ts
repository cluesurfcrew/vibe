// DO THE REGISTER MEMBER'S 88 FLAT MODES PER HALF STAY OUT OF LOW-ENERGY PHYSICS WHEN THE LIGHT OR THE SU(2)+ FIELD IS ON?
// (E-FRC-0284). The route "flat bands decouple" (roadmap routes/matter-forces-numbers.md, G · the particle count): each
// register half holds 96 modes a dock, 4 + 4 moving and 88 flat (E-FRC-0258); the 88 must not carry charge into low-energy
// physics. Read whether any flat mode couples to the light or the SU(2)+ field on a side-4 box. Kill: a flat mode carries
// charge and mixes with moving ones.
//
// WHAT IS RUN. E-FRC-0258's chiral register member (mixer u+ = ringUnit(-1, 4) on half +, u- = ringUnit(2, 2) on half -,
// beat 1 on Q_S, beat 2 conjugate on Q_D, each after the swap coin and the stream) on the D4 torus of side 4 (128 docks,
// 24,576 modes, code/measure/register-sea), with the light as E-SPN-0169's register-blind Peierls phase e^(i theta) on each
// link and the SU(2)+ field as E-SPN-0180's 2T link value acting on half + by right multiplication (code/measure/
// register-link-field), together or apart (code/measure/flat-bands). Static fields: trivial, a Weyl U(1) field over the
// whole circle (theta = 2 pi (w - 1/2), curved on almost every plaquette), a Weyl 2T field, and both. Changing fields: a
// field switched on for one beat only, and a slow drive that turns a field on and off over P beats.
//
// DERIVED BEFORE THE GATE RUN.
// 1. THE CHARGE OF A FLAT MODE (L1, a reading of E-SPN-0189). The tone is a species label no piece touches, so the charge
//    operator is a constant on a member's 192 modes, (pleasure - pain)/3 = +1/3 or -1/3, flat modes included; the Peierls
//    phase multiplies all 192 alike. SU(2)+ acts on half + by right multiplication, which commutes with every piece, so
//    the half + flat space is SU(2)+ invariant and holds 88 / 2 = 44 doublets a dock; half - flats are singlets. So the
//    first half of the kill (a flat mode carries charge) holds by construction. The route turns on the second half.
// 2. THE FLATS IN A STATIC FIELD (L1). U = V (1 + (conj u - 1) Q_D) V (1 + (u - 1) Q_S), where V, the swap coin and the
//    stream, is an involution in any static field whose reverse link carries the inverse (theta -> -theta, g -> g^-1): a
//    member that goes out over a link comes back over it. If Q_S f = 0 and Q_D V f = 0 then U f = V V f = f. So the
//    whole complement of W = range(Q_S) + V range(Q_D) is fixed by the cycle, in ANY static U(1) or SU(2)+ field, curved
//    or not, and since U is unitary W is invariant too: the flat space and the moving space do not mix. Per half W has
//    dimension 4N + 4N - #(mu = 1), mu the eigenvalues of B^dag B, B = E_S^dag V E_D the covariant Clifford hop between
//    the sectors (Jordan's lemma, as in E-SPN-0180): the moving levels sit at pi +- E(mu), cos E = cos M - 2 cos^2(M / 2)
//    mu, so a moving level reaches the flats' phase 0 only at mu = 1. On the free box mu is |s(K)|^2 / 4 at the 128 box
//    momenta, 4-fold per half, the exact values 0, 1/72, 1/24, 1/9, 1/8. PREDICTED: no mu = 1 in any of the four fields,
//    so 88 N = 11,264 flats per half exactly, fixed by the cycle to rounding, separated from the moving band by
//    pi - E(mu_max), above 2 rad a cycle (mu_max at most 0.2, from probe 1), against a light rest level at pi - M.
// 3. THE FLATS IN A CHANGING FIELD (argued, L2 measured). If the field differs between the out beat and the back beat,
//    V2 V1 is the change of the link value across a beat (the electric field), not 1, and U f = V2 V1 f leaves the flat
//    space at first order in the change: the flat mode is a charge bouncing across one link and it reads the electric
//    field. So a flat mode DOES couple to a changing light, with weight in the moving space quadratic in the change. But
//    the flats are degenerate at phase 0 in every static field and gapped from the moving band, so under a slow drive the
//    adiabatic theorem returns the state to the flat space: the leak falls at least as P^-2 with the drive's period P
//    (faster for a smooth envelope). A leak that stays finite at slow drive would be the flats carrying charge into
//    low-energy physics. PREDICTED: a one-beat field leaks (control), quadratically in its strength; the slow drive's
//    leak falls by at least 4 for each doubling of P from 32 to 512 beats and is below 1e-6 at P = 512.
//
// PROBES BEFORE THE GATES, disclosed. tmp/fb-probe1.log: on the four static fields every reverse rule holds, no mu = 1,
//  mu_max 0.125 (trivial), 0.156 (U(1)), 0.157 (half + in the 2T field; half - 0.125, the field acts on half + only),
//  0.155 (both); a Weyl start's flat part is fixed by the cycle to 5.6e-16 and its moving weight after one cycle is 9e-32;
//  the moving share of a Weyl start is 0.056 to 0.067 (8 / 96 = 0.083 on average). tmp/fb-probe2.log: on the free box mu
//  is |s(K)|^2 / 4 at the 128 momenta, 4-fold: 0 (160), 1/72 (96), 1/24 (128), 1/9 (96), 1/8 (32). tmp/fb-probe3.log: a
//  curved U(1) field on beat 1 only leaks 0.086 (strength 1), 2.7e-3 (0.1), 2.8e-5 (0.01) of a free flat state into the
//  moving space, the 2T field on beat 1 only 0.087; a sin^2 drive of amplitude 0.5 over P beats leaks, uniform field:
//  1.9e-3, 2.7e-2, 5.6e-4, 1.2e-5, 5.0e-7, 5.0e-8 at P = 4 .. 128; curved field: 8.0e-3, 2.4e-2, 5.2e-3, 1.1e-4,
//  5.7e-6, 3.6e-7. The gate thresholds below (mu_max <= 0.2, gap >= 2, the factor 4 per doubling, 1e-6 at P = 512, the
//  fast-drive control at P = 8) were set from these and the derivation; no gate was set after the gate run.
//
// HYPOTHESES AND GATES, fixed before the gate run.
//  I1 INSTRUMENT: on the free box, the mu spectrum of each half equals |s(K)|^2 / 4 at the 128 box momenta, each 4-fold,
//     sorted, to 1e-12; and the flat-part solver leaves a moving weight below 1e-26 of the flat part's norm.
//  C1 CONTROL (the instrument reads mixing): a curved U(1) field (strength 1) on beat 1 only leaks at least 1e-2 of a free
//     flat state's weight into the moving space, and the leaks at strengths 0.1 and 0.01 differ by a factor 80 to 120
//     (first order in the change); the fast drive (P = 8) leaks at least 1e-3 in both drive kinds.
//  H1 THE FLATS DECOUPLE: (a) on each of the four static fields, in each half: the reverse rule holds, no eigenvalue mu of
//     B^dag B above 1 - 1e-9 (so exactly 88 N = 11,264 flats per half), mu_max <= 0.2 and the gap pi - E(mu_max) >= 2;
//     a Weyl start's flat part f satisfies |U f - f| / |f| <= 1e-13 and moving weight of U f <= 1e-26 |f|^2; in the free
//     field every global SU(2)+ move Gamma(h) (24) keeps a half + flat state flat (moving weight <= 1e-26). (b) the slow
//     drive, uniform and curved: the leak at P = 32, 64, 128, 256, 512 falls by at least 4 per doubling and is <= 1e-6 at
//     P = 512.
//  P1 FALSIFIER: in some static field a flat state leaves the flat space (|U f - f| / |f| > 1e-12 or moving weight of U f
//     > 1e-24), or some mu reaches 1 (a moving level at the flats' phase), or the slow-drive leak at P = 512 is above 1e-4
//     or rises on a doubling from 128 on.
// VERDICT: fail if P1 fires; pass if I1, C1 and H1 hold; partial if P1 does not fire but I1, C1 or H1 misses (a miss at
// the float floor counts as partial).
//
// WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT SHOW. It reads one member (one-body) on a 128-dock box with static and driven link fields,
// the light as a Peierls phase on the bulk stream (as E-SPN-0169 coupled it; the husk light's own dynamics and split,
// E-FRC-0261, 0262, are not run, only its value on the links), and the SU(2)+ field as fixed 2T values. It shows whether
// the flat space is invariant and gapped. It cannot show what the many-body vacuum does with the flats (whether they are
// filled, E-SPN-0175's flat count), whether a pair piece or a collision mixes them in (E-FRC-0273's join acts on the
// sectors, not on the flats), or what flats do on the true hyperbolic mesh. A flat mode stays a charge: if one is
// occupied it is a static charge of 1/3 that sources the light; this experiment reads only that it cannot move or mix
// at low energy.
//
// FIRST RUN 2026-10-02 (tmp/fb-run1.log, 14 s): PASS, as predicted; every gate holds and P1 does not fire. No gate moved
//  and none was rerun.
//  - I1: the free box's mu equals |s(K)|^2 / 4 at the 128 momenta to 8.4e-15; the flat-part solver leaves 2.0e-32.
//  - H1a: in all four static fields and both halves, no mu = 1, so 11,264 = 88 x 128 flats per half; mu_max 0.125
//    (trivial), 0.156 (U(1)), 0.157 (2T, half +; half - 0.125), 0.155 / 0.156 (both); the least gap pi - E(mu_max) is
//    2.246 rad a cycle (rest levels at pi - M, M = 0.380 and 0.287); a flat state is fixed by the cycle to 5.6e-16 and its
//    moving weight after a cycle is at most 9.1e-32; the 24 global SU(2)+ moves keep a half + flat state flat (1.9e-32).
//  - C1: a curved U(1) field on one beat leaks 8.6e-2, 2.7e-3, 2.8e-5 at strengths 1, 0.1, 0.01 (ratio 99.5, first order
//    in the change), the 2T field on one beat 8.7e-2; the fast drive (P = 8) leaks 2.7e-2 (uniform) and 2.4e-2 (curved).
//  - H1b: the slow drive's leak, uniform: 1.2e-5, 5.0e-7, 5.0e-8, 3.0e-9, 2.4e-10 at P = 32 .. 512; curved: 1.1e-4,
//    5.7e-6, 3.6e-7, 2.3e-8, 1.6e-9; each doubling divides it by 6 to 23.
//  So a flat mode carries charge (1/3, and a doublet in half +) but no static light or SU(2)+ field mixes it with moving
//  modes, because the swap coin and stream undo each other over a cycle; only a change of the field within a cycle (the
//  electric field) mixes it, at first order, and across a gap of about 2.25 rad a cycle, so a slow drive leaves it in
//  the flat space. The many-body vacuum and the true mesh are not read.
