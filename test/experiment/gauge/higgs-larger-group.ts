// A LARGER LINK GROUP, OR A WILSON LINE TO THE SCREEN? (E-FRC-0279, routes 3 and 4 of "G · the Higgs mechanism" in
// note/research/vibe/roadmap/routes/matter-forces-numbers.md, OPEN-WKF-03, decision 1 in gaps.md). Nothing breaks SU(2)+
// (E-FRC-0268). The center of each dock's 2T acts as -J (E-FRC-0273), a link is odd under it at both ends, so every
// gauge-invariant operator holds an even number of half + fields, and a Higgs needs a scalar odd under that center.
// E-FRC-0277 closed "the frame is the Higgs" as a reading of the rule. This file runs the two routes left that could
// still find such a scalar inside the model, one hypothesis each.
//  (a) A LARGER LINK GROUP (Manton 1979, Hosotani 1983: gauge-Higgs unification). If the links take values in a group G
//      larger than the dock's 2T, the components of the link outside 2T can carry 2T charge, as SU(3)'s adjoint holds
//      two doublets under its SU(2). The route's candidates: Sigma(648) (the links' color group, E-QTM-0117, E-FRC-0278),
//      2O, 2I, or W(F4) itself. Its test: a character count of the restriction to the dock's 2T. Its kill: zero
//      center-odd pieces for every candidate.
//  (b) A WILSON LINE TO THE SCREEN (Dirac 1955, dressed charges). A link is odd under the center at both ends, so a line
//      that ends where gauge moves are frozen is odd at one end only. If the moves were frozen at the screen's 18 down
//      slots, psi_+ dressed by a line to the screen would be center-odd and gauge-invariant in the bulk. Its test: whether
//      SU(2)+'s Gauss law holds exactly at screen docks. Its kill: it does, so nothing is frozen.
// The two are one question asked two ways (is there a center-odd object the rule already carries?), so they share a file.
//
// WHAT IS RUN. (a) Each candidate is realized as a group acting on the member WITH the dock's 2T inside it (the 24
// Hurwitz units acting by Gamma(h) = P- + P+ R(h) on half +, code/measure/register-link-field registerGauge), because the
// route asks for the restriction to THAT 2T, whose center z = Gamma(-1) is -J:
//   2T     the dock's 2T alone (the baseline, 24 elements).
//   2O, 2I the binary octahedral and icosahedral groups acting by right multiplication on half + (the linear extension
//          of Gamma to all of H is an algebra map, since 2T spans H), group tables from code/measure/hurwitz-gauge.
//   2T x Sigma(648)  the links' color group acts on the role, a separate factor (E-FND-0160), so the smallest group
//          holding it and the dock's 2T is the direct product.
//   W+     the group generated on the 192 modes by the 2T and W(F4)'s rotations (det +1), acting as code/measure/
//          spinor-register f4Group does (slot permutation times the minors on the register). W(F4) alone holds no element
//          acting as a nontrivial Gamma(h) (E-FRC-0277), so "W(F4) itself" needs the generated group.
//   W      the same with all of W(F4), mirrors included.
// For a finite link group the link's components are functions on G, and a gauge move h at the link's end turns them by
// conjugation (the finite group's adjoint). Its character is chi(g) = |C_G(g)|, so the center-odd part restricted to
// the 2T has dimension (|G| - |C_G(z)|) / 2 and the multiplicity of each 2T irrep R is (1/24) sum_h |C_G(phi(h))|
// conj(chi_R(h)), exact over the Eisenstein integers (hurwitzCharacters). A link group can be gauged on the rule only if
// every element keeps the rule's pieces at a dock (the condition E-FRC-0271 G1 checked for the 2T), so each group's
// generators are checked against 24 Q_S, 48 Q_D, 48 Q_D chi and chi (registerGap, integers).
// (b) The true mesh at a cusp (code/substrate/coxeter/labelled-region cuspRegion, skin 4, depth 1, the region of
// E-SPN-0181), a 2T link on every link, the transport rule of code/measure/cusp-register (slot d of dock x goes to slot d
// of the neighbour across label d; the link back is slot -d there, read). The beat is an integer dock piece K = X (1 +
// 24 Q_S + 48 Q_D + 48 Q_D chi + chi), built from the same projectors the rule's pieces are, then the stream with each
// value turned by 4 Gamma(U) of the link it crosses. Gauss's law at a dock is the statement that a local move there
// (register and the ends of its links) commutes with the beat; it is read exactly, integer state against integer state,
// with the moves on the layer docks only and on every dock.
//
// DERIVED BEFORE THE GATE RUN.
// 1. A COUNT IS NONZERO EXACTLY WHEN z IS NOT CENTRAL IN G. (|G| - |C_G(z)|) / 2 is 0 iff C_G(z) = G. In 2O and 2I the
//    element -1 is the center of the whole group, so every component of their links is center-even: 0. In 2T x
//    Sigma(648) the 2T factor's center commutes with the other factor: 0. In W+ a rotation acts on half + of the even
//    forms as conjugation by a unit quaternion, which commutes with -1 there, so z = -J is central: 0. A mirror swaps the
//    halves (E-FRC-0277 C1, C+ rho C+ = -rho), so in W it sends z = -J to +J: z is not central, and the count is nonzero.
//    Its center-odd components sit on the half-swapping elements: z g z^-1 = -g there (the scalar -1 on the 192 modes),
//    and the same under the SU(2)- center J, so they are odd under both centers, a (2, 2).
// 2. ONLY W FAILS TO KEEP THE RULE. Right multiplications commute with every piece (E-FRC-0268), Sigma(648) does not act
//    on the register, rotations keep the rule (E-FRC-0274 G2), but a mirror sends chi = 2 P+ to 2 P-, so the chiral
//    pieces break. So the one nonzero count belongs to a group that cannot be gauged on the chiral register rule.
// 3. THE SCREEN DOCK IS AN ORDINARY DOCK. At a layer dock all 24 slots are links: 6 on the layer, 18 down, 0 up
//    (E-SPN-0181 M1), and nothing lies above. The dock piece commutes with 1 x Gamma(h) (E-FRC-0271), and a stream across
//    a link is covariant link by link. So a local move at a layer dock commutes with the beat exactly, as at any dock:
//    Gauss's law holds at the screen and no end is frozen. A frozen end would be a link whose far end no move turns,
//    which is a new boundary piece.
// 4. WHAT A LARGER GROUP CAN CARRY, AS SU(3) DOES. Sigma(648) holds copies of 2T = SL(2, 3) (the qutrit Clifford
//    group's symplectic part) up to its scalar center Z3, whose center is an involution of SU(3), trace -1, not central. Restricted to such
//    a copy the adjoint 8 has center-odd dimension (8 - (|tr z|^2 - 1)) / 2 = 4, two doublets, and the triplet has 2:
//    Manton's mechanism in the finite group. That copy acts on the role and not on half +, so it is not the dock's 2T;
//    it is the control that the count can read nonzero.
//
// PROBES BEFORE THE GATES, disclosed (no gate was moved after the gate run).
//  tmp/hl-probe1.log (killed after 210 s, a slow closure over all 600 elements as generators): Gamma is a homomorphism,
//   W(F4) holds 1 element acting as a Gamma(h) (the identity), and the group of the 576 rotations with the 2T has 13,824
//   elements with |C(z)| = 13,824, center-odd dimension 0 (point 1). The mirror group was not reached. This file uses
//   small generating sets instead.
//  tmp/hl-probe2.log (2 s): the skin 4 depth 1 region has 2,451 docks, 0 inconsistent steps; reading the link back as
//   slot d at the neighbour gave 0 two-sided links, slot -d gave 7,284 of 7,284 (so the link back is slot -d); 63 layer
//   docks with all 24 neighbours, all 6 on the layer, 18 down, 0 up; the integer beat's covariance gap 0 with the moves on
//   the layer docks and on every dock; with the down links carried bare (no link value) the gap is 4,160 and 4,016.
//  tmp/hl-smoke.log (178 s, after the gates were written, gating nothing): every code path of this file on the skin 2
//   region (475 docks, 7 full layer docks). It showed the group counts the gate run reads (they do not depend on the
//   region): 2T, 2O, 2I, 2T x Sigma(648) and W+ count 0 and keep the rule; W has 663,552 elements, not the 27,648 first
//   expected (its mirrors bring the SU(2)- copy of the 2T in too), |C(z)| = 331,776 = |W| / 2, center-odd dimension
//   165,888, and breaks the rule (gap 4); the screen gap 0 in both modes, the bare control 4,016, the float read
//   1.1e-15. C1 failed in its first form (no 2T of order 24 found); see C1. Nothing else was changed.
//  tmp/hl-probe3.log: Sigma(648) has 9 involutions (trace -1), 6 square roots of each, a Q8 from two of them, and 62
//   normalizing elements outside the Q8, each closing with it at 72 with one involution, none of order 3.
//  tmp/hl-smoke2.log (skin 2, after C1 was restated): C1 holds (order 72, |C(z)| 72, conjugation count 288, adjoint 8
//   count 4, triplet 2), the rest as in the first smoke.
//
// HYPOTHESES AND GATES, fixed before the gate run.
//  I1 INSTRUMENT (a). Gamma is an exact homomorphism and 4 Gamma(-1) = -4 J; the two chosen units generate exactly the 24
//     Gamma(h); 2O and 2I close at 48 and 120 with associative tables, and each holds the 24 Hurwitz units; Sigma(648)'s
//     generators (rebuilt in Q(zeta_9) as in E-FRC-0278) close at 648; 2T's seven characters are exactly orthogonal; for
//     every candidate the seven multiplicities are nonnegative integers and twice the sum over the center-odd irreps (2,
//     2', 2'') equals the dimension count (|G| - |C_G(z)|) / 2; P-, P+ and P+ A_k keep every rule projector (gap 0).
//  I2 INSTRUMENT (b). The region has 0 inconsistent steps; every link is two-sided (slot d at x reaches n, slot -d at n
//     reaches x); at least one layer dock has all 24 neighbours in the region and every such dock splits 6 on the layer,
//     18 down, 0 up; K is an integer matrix and commutes exactly with 1 x 4 Gamma(h) for all 24 h.
//  C1 THE COUNT CAN READ NONZERO. Inside Sigma(648) a subgroup of order 72 with exactly one involution z, generated by
//     two non-commuting elements squaring to z (a Q8) and an element w outside it that normalizes it with w^3 a scalar,
//     is found: a 2T times Sigma(648)'s center Z3 (72 / 3 = 24); z is not central in Sigma(648); its conjugation count
//     (648 - |C(z)|) / 2 is positive, the adjoint 8's center-odd dimension is 4 and the triplet's is 2. (Written first
//     as a subgroup of order 24 with w of order 3; the smoke below found none, and tmp/hl-probe3.log showed why: every
//     normalizing w outside Q8 has w^3 = a nontrivial scalar, so 2T sits in Sigma(648) only with its center Z3
//     attached. C1 was restated so before the gate run; the count it reads depends only on z.)
//  C2 GAUSS'S LAW CAN READ BROKEN. The same beat with the screen's down links carried bare (a frozen end, the route's
//     premise built by hand), the moves on the layer docks: the covariance gap at the layer docks is positive.
//  H1 ROUTE (a): some candidate that keeps the rule (every generator's gap 0) has a positive center-odd count.
//  H2 ROUTE (b): Gauss's law fails at the screen: with the link field on every link, the covariance gap at some layer
//     dock is positive, for the moves on the layer docks or on every dock.
//  P1 FALSIFIER (both routes closed): every rule-keeping candidate counts 0, and the gap at the screen is exactly 0.
//  PREDICTED: P1. 2T, 2O, 2I, 2T x Sigma(648) and W+ count 0 and keep the rule; W counts |W| / 4 (|C_W(z)| = |W| / 2,
//   the half-keeping elements) and breaks the rule through its mirrors; the screen gap is 0 in both gauge modes.
// VERDICT, fixed before the gate run: FAIL (as derived) when H1 and H2 both fail with I1, I2, C1, C2 holding; PASS when H1
// or H2 holds with them; PARTIAL when an instrument or control fails.
// READ, gating nothing. Each group's order, |C(z)| and the seven multiplicities; for W the elements that move z, whether
// they are exactly the half-swapping ones and whether z and J both send each to its negative; |C_Sigma(z)|; the same
// covariance read in floats with the rule's own chiral pieces (sector S at u+ = ringUnit(-1, 4), u- = ringUnit(2, 2), then
// sector D at the conjugates, E-FRC-0274's units) for the moves on the layer docks.
//
// WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT SHOW. It can show, exactly, which link groups holding the dock's 2T carry center-odd link
// components, and whether the screen's docks keep Gauss's law under the rule's transport. It cannot rule out a link group
// outside the list (any group in which z is central counts 0, by point 1, so the list's reach is that criterion), and it
// does not re-read the link field's electric and magnetic pieces on the true mesh (their covariance is the class-function
// argument of E-FRC-0271, which holds on any closed loop). A region is finite; its frontier docks lack neighbours deep in
// the bulk, not at the screen, and the screen docks read are the ones with all 24 neighbours present.
//
// FIRST RUN 2026-10-02 (tmp/hl-frc-run1.log, 176 s): FAIL, as derived. P1 holds; I1, I2, C1 and C2 hold; no gate moved
// and none was rerun.
//  - H1 fails. Center-odd dimension of the link components restricted to the dock's 2T, by (|G| - |C_G(z)|) / 2 and by
//    the seven exact multiplicities: 2T 0 (order 24), 2O 0 (48), 2I 0 (120), 2T x Sigma(648) 0 (15,552), W+ 0 (13,824);
//    every one keeps the rule (gap 0), and in every one the 2, 2' and 2'' appear 0 times. Only W, the group the 2T and
//    all of W(F4) generate, counts: 663,552 elements, |C(z)| = 331,776, center-odd dimension 165,888 (27,648 each of 2,
//    2', 2''), and its mirrors break the rule's chiral pieces (gap 4). The 331,776 elements of W that move z are exactly
//    its half-swapping elements, and z and J each send every one to its negative: odd under both centers, a (2, 2).
//    W(F4) alone holds 1 element acting as a Gamma(h), the identity.
//  - H2 fails. On the cusp region (2,451 docks, 7,284 links, all two-sided, 0 inconsistent steps) the 63 layer docks with
//    all 24 neighbours split 6 on the layer, 18 down, 0 up, and the integer covariance gap is exactly 0 at every layer dock
//    with the moves on the layer docks, and 0 everywhere with the moves on every dock. Gauss's law holds at the screen.
//  - C1: a 2T x Z3 of order 72 inside Sigma(648), its involution z (trace -1) not central, |C(z)| = 72, conjugation
//    count 288, adjoint 8 count 4 (two doublets), triplet 2. C2: with the down links carried bare the gap at the layer
//    docks is 4,160. READ: the rule's own chiral pieces keep the covariance in floats to 1.1e-15.
// WHAT IT MEANS. Neither route finds a center-odd object in the present model. A link group's components carry the
// dock's center only if that center stops being central, and every group that keeps the chiral register rule (2O, 2I,
// the color group beside it, the rotations) leaves it central. The one group that does not is the one with mirrors,
// whose center-odd components are exactly the half-swapping elements, odd under both centers: the bidoublet's quantum
// numbers, reached only by gauging a parity the chiral rule does not keep. The screen is not a boundary for SU(2)+: its
// docks have all 24 links and keep Gauss's law exactly, so a Wilson line has no frozen end to stop at. For decision 1
// this removes the last two internal routes; the added scalar's options stay the diagonal frame (E-FRC-0277) and the
// bidoublet, and this run shows the bidoublet is what a mirror-holding link group would supply.
//
