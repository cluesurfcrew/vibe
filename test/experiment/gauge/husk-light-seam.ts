// THE SEAM OF THE 3D QUANTUM LIGHT, CALIBRATED ON THE LADDER (E-FRC-0282, OPEN-LGT-12, the route "the one-quantum
// sector" in routes/quantum-relativity-light-computation.md, section "D · a quantum photon that travels"). The route
// asks to build one quantum over the Gauss-invariant vacuum on a side-8 husk and read how much leaves the one-quantum
// sector per beat against D = 4 .. 16, killed if the leak per beat does not fall with D. That cannot be run as
// written: the 3D light has about N^(8V) states, and the leak is a property of the full, non-Gaussian vacuum. The
// ladder (E-FRC-0231, 0235) shows where every departure lives: the beat's drift phase zeta_M^(-c bal(e)^2) and the
// force phase are exact quadratic (metaplectic) maps away from each register's seam at +-D, and in that harmonic
// reading the one-quantum band IS the classical symbol exactly. So the departure is the vacuum's weight at the seams.
// This file computes that weight from the harmonic two-point function, calibrates it against the ladder's exact band
// misses, and carries it to the 3D husk light as a frozen prediction of the one-quantum leak per beat against D.
//
// WHAT IS RUN.
//  (a) THE LADDER, exact. quantum-ladder oneQuantumBand on E-FRC-0231's boxes, the split with the drift carrying
//      kappa = 2/N (c = 2, r = N: s = 2/N, f = 1): L = 2 at N = 9, 13, 17, 21, 25 and L = 3 at N = 9, 11, 13; and the
//      classical split (c = N, r = 2: s = 1, f = 2/N) at L = 2, N = 9, 13. The band error is E-FRC-0231's: the
//      largest |omega_quantum - omega_classical| / omega_classical over the box's momenta.
//  (b) THE LADDER, harmonic. code/measure/husk-light-seam on husk-balance's ladderLight at the same boxes and splits.
//  (c) THE HUSK, harmonic. The same measure on husk-balance's huskLight (9 link directions a dock, weights 1 on an
//      axis and 2 on a diagonal; 20 husk triangle types, n_P = 1 on 8 and 2 on 12; E-FRC-0262), on the side-8 box's
//      momenta (2 pi j / 8 per axis, the route's box), at D = 4 .. 16, N = 2D + 1, at the two candidate splits
//      rho = f / s = 0.4613818 (the average, E-FRC-0262) and 0.4146386 (the worst register, E-FRC-0269).
//
// DERIVED BEFORE THE GATE RUN.
// 1. THE HARMONIC VACUUM. Per eigenmode of A(k) = W^(1/2) C^dag N C W^(1/2) (lambda > 0) the leapfrog y' = y + s pi,
//    pi' = pi - f A y' (y = W^(1/2) x, pi = W^(1/2) e) has 2 - 2 cos omega = s f lambda and invariant Gaussian
//    <|y|^2> = (hbar / 2) s / sin omega, <|pi|^2> = (hbar / 2) f lambda / sin omega, hbar = N / (2 pi). A link's
//    variance is the box average of (hbar / 2)(f lambda / sin omega)|v_l|^2 / w_l, a plaquette's of (hbar / 2)
//    (s / sin omega)|(C W^(1/2) v)_P|^2. On the ladder (w = n = 1, A = K = 4 - 2 cos k) this is quantum-ladder's
//    harmonicTwoPoint register by register: rails Gamma_mm(0), rung 2 (Gamma_mm(0) - Gamma_mm(1)), plaquette
//    Gamma_BB(0). The gauge directions (lambda = 0, at k = 0 also the static photon, the winding sector the ladder
//    holds at 0) carry no register variance and are left out.
// 2. THE HUSK'S SCALE. husk-balance's A is exactly twice E-FRC-0179's husk symbol M_h = C^T N C G^(-1) (G^(-1) =
//    W / 2): its axis photon lambda_A / 2 solves lambda^2 - 12 lambda + 8u = 0 (E-FRC-0235) and its massive branch
//    sits at 2 x 12. With E-FRC-0207's kappa = 2/(2D + 1) on M_h, the husk light in husk-balance's variables runs at
//    s f = kappa / 2 = 1 / N, so s = (1 / (N rho))^(1/2), f = (rho / N)^(1/2). kappa lambda_max(M_h) = 32 / N < 4 for
//    D >= 4. One modulus N reaches every husk register (E-FRC-0269), each read balanced in -D .. D, with the
//    quadratic phase exp(-i pi q bal(x)^2 / N), q = s w_l on a link and f n_P on a triangle (on the ladder q = s and f).
// 3. THE SEAM STATISTIC. The beat is the harmonic one times 1 + Delta per register, Delta(x) = exp(-i pi q (bal(x)^2
//    - x^2) / N) - 1, zero for |x| <= D. A one-quantum state of a mode that puts variance c on a register of variance
//    sigma^2 has that register's marginal p_0(x)(1 + beta (x^2 / sigma^2 - 1)), beta = c / sigma^2 (from <1|exp(itX)|1>
//    = chi_0(t)(1 - t^2 c)). So, to first order in Delta, the one-quantum level moves against the vacuum by
//       Phi = |Im sum_registers beta a| / omega,   a = E_0[(x^2 / sigma^2 - 1) Delta(x)]   (relative band shift)
//    and the quantum carries an excess seam kick per beat
//       ell = sum_registers beta b,                b = E_0[(x^2 / sigma^2 - 1) |Delta(x)|^2]   (the leak reading)
//    E_0 the integer Gaussian p_0(x) ~ exp(-x^2 / (2 sigma^2)). The box statistic is the largest over the box's modes.
//    Also read: the plain Gaussian seam weight w = P(|x| > D + 1/2) per register, its sum per dock and its maximum.
//    The prediction (argued, first order): Phi IS the exact band error, with no constant.
// 4. WHY THE ROUTE'S KILL CANNOT FIRE IN THE GAUSSIAN READING (argued before the run, gated as H1). With hbar = N / (2 pi)
//    and s f = 1 / N, a link's variance is about hbar (f / s)^(1/2) lambda^(1/2) ~ N rho^(1/2) and a triangle's about
//    N rho^(-1/2), while the seam sits at D ~ N / 2: D^2 / sigma^2 grows like N at a fixed split, so every Gaussian
//    seam weight falls like exp(-const N) and the leak with it. A light whose registers do NOT deepen with D (the
//    modulus held at 9 while kappa follows D) has variances nearly independent of kappa, so its seam weight does not
//    fall: the control C1b.
//
// PROBES BEFORE THE GATES, DISCLOSED. tmp/ls-probe1.ts: husk-balance's husk A(k) along an axis (0.1197 at k = 0.3,
//    3.0557 at pi/2, 8 at pi; massive 24) and its largest eigenvalue on a 10-grid, 31.71; this showed the factor 2 of
//    point 2 before it was written. tmp/ls-probe2.ts timed oneQuantumBand: 9 s at N = 25, L = 2, 152 s at N = 13,
//    L = 3. tmp/ls-probe3.ts: the measure's ladder variances against harmonicTwoPoint at (N, L) = (9, 2), (25, 2),
//    (13, 3), equal to 12 digits (rails 0.949552, rung 1.519284, plaquette 0.759642 at N = 9, L = 2), erfc against
//    two reference values (1.2e-7 relative), and one husk reading's time (1.0 s). No seam statistic was printed for
//    any ladder box or any husk depth before the gates. NOT BLIND: E-FRC-0231's band errors were known (4.9e-3,
//    2.6e-4, 1.7e-4, 1.7e-5, 7.1e-6 at L = 2), and while designing, a hand estimate of the L = 2 rung's Gaussian seam
//    weight (variance 1.519 at N = 9, 6.12 at N = 25, so w = 2.6e-4 and 4.4e-7) put the band error at about 19 and 16
//    times w. That is why the calibration below is tested out of sample (L = 3, and the classical split).
//
// HYPOTHESES AND GATES, fixed before the gate run, never moved.
//  I1 INSTRUMENT: (a) on every ladder box and split, the measure's rail, rung and plaquette variances equal
//     harmonicTwoPoint's within 1e-12 relative; (b) the harmonic two-point function is invariant under one classical
//     beat (classicalBeat), |M Gamma M^T - Gamma| / |Gamma| <= 1e-12, on every drift box; (c) the exact band errors
//     reproduce E-FRC-0231's recorded values (4.9e-3, 2.6e-4, 1.7e-4, 1.7e-5, 7.1e-6; 2.0e-3, 2.0e-3, 4.7e-4) within
//     4 percent (their two-digit rounding); (d) on the husk at k = pi j / 8 along an axis (j = 1 .. 8) the lowest
//     positive lambda_A / 2 solves lambda^2 - 12 lambda + 8u = 0 within 1e-9, and at k = 0 the positive eigenvalues
//     are 24 within 1e-9.
//  C1 CONTROLS, the instrument reads the other outcome: (a) on the classical split (L = 2, N = 9 and 13), where the
//     exact band misses by more than 10 times the drift split's (E-FRC-0231 S2), the seam statistic Phi is also more
//     than 10 times the drift split's at both N, and the exact miss is recomputed more than 10 times; (b) the husk
//     with its register modulus held at 9 while kappa = 2/(2D + 1) follows D (rho = 0.4613818): the seam weight per
//     dock at D = 16 is at least half its value at D = 4 (it does not fall).
//  HC THE CALIBRATION LAW, fixed: band error = A Phi, one constant. A is the geometric mean of error / Phi over the
//     five L = 2 drift boxes. Gate: on every L = 2 box error / (A Phi) is in [1/2, 2]; the least-squares slope of
//     ln error on ln Phi over the L = 2 boxes is in [0.75, 1.33]; and out of sample, on the three L = 3 boxes,
//     error / (A Phi) is in [1/3, 3]. Read, not gated: A itself (point 3 predicts A = 1), and the same fits on the
//     plain seam weight (the largest per register, and the sum per square) and on D^2 / sigma_max^2.
//  H1 THE ROUTE, frozen prediction: the calibrated leak per beat Lambda(D) = A ell_husk(D) and the calibrated band
//     shift A Phi_husk(D), at both candidate splits, fall at every step D -> D + 1 over D = 4 .. 16, and Lambda(16)
//     <= Lambda(4) / 100.
//  P1 THE FALSIFIER (the route's kill): at either split Lambda(16) >= Lambda(4), the leak per beat does not fall.
// READ: the husk's register variances and seam weights by class (axis links, diagonal links, n_P = 1 and n_P = 2
//    triangles), the mode the band and the leak peak at, and the two splits' seam per dock and Lambda against each
//    other at every D (OPEN-LGT-02: they "differ" if the ratio is outside [1/2, 2] at D = 16); the infinite-volume
//    variances (a 16-grid, midpoint) at D = 4 and 16.
// VERDICT: fail if P1 holds (the route is killed) or I1 or C1 fails; pass if I1, C1, HC and H1 hold; partial if I1
//    and C1 hold and P1 does not, but HC or H1 fails.
//
// WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT SHOW. Exact: the ladder's band errors (dense Floquet spectra of the rule) and the harmonic
// algebra (point 1, the variances, checked against harmonicTwoPoint). The Gaussian reading: the seam statistics (the
// vacuum is taken as the harmonic Gaussian; its true, non-Gaussian weight near the seam is what the ladder
// calibration is for), first order in Delta. Extrapolated: the 3D numbers, through (i) a quantum husk light that does
// not exist yet (one modulus N, the husk-balance energy, the quadratic register phases of point 2), (ii) the ladder's
// constant A carried from the ladder's split (rho = N / 2) to the husk's (about 0.4) and from 1D boxes to 3D, and
// (iii) the leak reading ell, which is a first-order excess kick, not the exact flow out of the sector. So a pass
// says the Gaussian seam reading, calibrated where it can be, predicts a leak that falls with D; it cannot show the
// 3D light is free in its one-quantum sector, and a non-Gaussian vacuum effect the ladder does not have would escape it.
//
// Depth L2: dense Floquet spectra of the model's ladder light and harmonic (Gaussian) algebra of its 3D husk light on
// a symbol grid, doubles with residuals.
//
// FIRST RUN 2026-10-02 (tmp/ls-run1.log, 128 s): FAIL by the verdict rule, on C1b, a defect in point 4 of the
// derivation. No gate moved, no rerun. I1 held: the measure's ladder variances equal harmonicTwoPoint's to 6.8e-16,
// the two-point function is beat-invariant to 6.1e-16, the exact band errors reproduce E-FRC-0231 within 1.4 percent
// (4.94e-3, 2.56e-4, 1.71e-4, 1.72e-5, 7.13e-6 at L = 2; 2.01e-3, 1.99e-3, 4.67e-4 at L = 3), the husk axis photon
// solves lambda^2 - 12 lambda + 8u = 0 to 3.2e-14 and the k = 0 massive branch is 24 to 4.3e-14. C1a held: the
// classical split's seam shift is 22.4 and 80.0 times the drift split's (N = 9, 13), its exact miss 1,669 and 1,462
// times. C1b FAILED: with the register modulus held at 9 while kappa follows D, the seam weight per dock FALLS, 5.04e-2
// at D = 4 to 6.44e-3 at D = 16 (leak 0.238 to 0.0117, band 0.040 to 0.0116). Point 4's claim that such a light's
// variances do not depend on kappa holds only at small s f lambda; at D = 4 the husk's top modes sit near omega = pi
// (s f lambda up to 32/9), where 1 / sin omega inflates every register's variance, and that inflation leaves as kappa
// falls. So the instrument was NOT shown to read a leak that does not fall, and part of every fall below (D = 4 to
// about 6) is this band-top inflation, not the column's depth. HC held: the first-order Gaussian seam shift Phi
// (2.97e-3, 4.75e-4, 1.05e-4, 2.81e-5, 8.64e-6 at L = 2) reads the exact errors with A = 0.942 (point 3 predicted 1,
// with no constant), slope 1.092, calibrated ratios 1.76, 0.57, 1.73, 0.65, 0.88, and out of sample on L = 3 0.62,
// 1.43, 0.72. The plain largest seam weight fits as well (slope 0.998, largest ln residual 0.654, against 0.675 for
// Phi); D^2 / sigma^2 alone does not (slope -0.52). H1 held and P1 did not fire, a frozen prediction for the side-8
// husk at kappa = 2/(2D + 1): the calibrated one-quantum leak per beat falls at every step, 2.24e-1, 3.53e-2, 8.64e-3,
// 2.19e-3, 5.64e-4, 1.47e-4, 3.84e-5, 1.01e-5, 2.67e-6, 7.07e-7, 1.88e-7, 5.00e-8, 1.33e-8 for D = 4 .. 16 at rho
// 0.4614, and 2.15e-1 .. 4.77e-9 at rho 0.4146. The leak peaks on massive modes, not the photon: lambda_A = 32 (band
// top, k = (0, pi, pi)) at D = 4, 23.39 at D = 16. Largest husk registers: the axis links (variance 2.88 at D = 4,
// 6.95 at D = 16; seam weight 8.0e-3 and 3.8e-10), then the n_P = 1 triangles (2.27, 5.88). OPEN-LGT-02: the two
// splits' seam per dock agree within 6 percent at D = 4 to 6 and part with depth (worst over average 0.536 at D = 16,
// just inside the pre-set [1/2, 2], so not "different" by the stated rule; the leak ratio is 0.358 at D = 16). The
// worst-register split leaks less at every D >= 4, by an amount that grows with D. Infinite-volume variances (16-grid)
// match the side-8 box within 1e-4 relative.
