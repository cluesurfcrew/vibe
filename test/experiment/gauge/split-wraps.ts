// THE WORST REGISTER NEVER WRAPS (E-FRC-0286, OPEN-LGT-02; the route "the worst register never wraps" in
// routes/mind-whole-engine-techniques.md, section "Q · no free parameters"). The husk light's split rho = f / s is
// undecided between the average reading 0.4613818 (E-FRC-0262) and the worst-register reading 0.4146386 (E-FRC-0269).
// The route: the split at which the most-filled register just stays inside its range is an integer condition, not an
// energy, so count wraps per register class at both splits on the carried light; killed if both splits wrap equally.
//
// WHAT IS RUN.
//  THE CARRIED LIGHT WITH A SEAM ON EACH SIDE (code/measure/split-wraps). E-FRC-0265 showed the trit rule's own light
//  has a seam on the magnetic side only (|e| ran past D on 65 percent of link-beats), and at fixed kappa its split is
//  a change of units (E-FRC-0276): with no electric seam the split cannot enter. So the light run here is the husk
//  light of E-FRC-0262 (9 links a dock, w = 1 on the 3 axes and 2 on the 6 face diagonals; 20 triangles a dock, n_P =
//  1 on 8 and 2 on 12) with BOTH shares carried as integers and BOTH registers read balanced in -D .. D: the drift x'
//  = x + s e and the force e' = e - f C^T N B, s = c / q and f = r / q, each paid through a remainder counter (first
//  form, "carry, never round", E-FRC-0214), B = C W x read modulo N = 2D + 1, e kept balanced modulo N. This is the
//  classical counterpart of E-FRC-0269's quantum light, where one modulus reaches every register. It is a bijection
//  of the integer state and keeps the divergence of e modulo N.
//  THE STATE. Side-8 husk torus (the route's box: 4,608 links, 10,240 triangles), D = 16 (N = 33), kappa = s f = 1 / N
//  exactly (E-FRC-0282 point 2: the trit light's kappa = 2 / N on M_h is 1 / N in these variables; kappa lambda_max =
//  32/33). The start is the Gibbs state of the leapfrog's own conserved quadratic form at temperature T (per mode the
//  covariance T M^(-1), M = [[f lambda, f lambda s / 2], [f lambda s / 2, s]]), drawn with Weyl normals per momentum
//  of the box and rounded to integers. T is fixed by the worst-register split: the axis links' model variance there
//  puts the seam D + 1/2 at z = 3 and at z = 4 standard deviations (two temperatures). The same T and the same Weyl
//  stream (1) at every split, so the splits are compared on paired starts. 16,000 beats per run.
//  THE COUNT. A register wraps when its unwrapped new value leaves -D .. D: a link's e at the kick, a triangle's B at
//  the drift (the angle x itself is bookkeeping, E-FRC-0265). Wraps are counted per class: axis links, diagonal
//  links, n_P = 1 triangles, n_P = 2 triangles, per register and beat. THE CONDITION, stated: at a fixed temperature
//  the split at which the most-wrapping link class and the most-wrapping triangle class wrap at one rate, R(rho) =
//  max(link class rates) / max(triangle class rates) = 1; on each side of it one side's worst register wraps first.
//  rho* is read by linear interpolation of ln R in ln rho over the scan rho_j = 0.4146386 x 1.1127^(j/2), j = -3 .. 4
//  (each realised as the carried split nearest it with kappa = 1 / N exact, m <= 3000).
//
// DERIVED BEFORE THE GATE RUN.
//  1. THE FILLS. At fixed T and kappa a link's variance is (T / s) a_h and a triangle's (T / f) b_t, so links grow as
//     rho^(1/2) and triangles fall as rho^(-1/2) (s = (kappa / rho)^(1/2), f = (kappa rho)^(1/2)). Where wraps are rare
//     the wrap rate is a Gaussian tail, exp(-(D + 1/2)^2 / (2 sigma^2)) times a prefactor set by the lag-one
//     correlation, so R = 1 sits where the most-filled link class and the most-filled triangle class have nearly
//     equal variance: the worst-register balance (axis against n_P = 1), moved only by the prefactors' ratio over
//     z^2 / 2. As T falls (z grows) rho* tends to that balance exactly. So THE CONDITION IS THE WORST-REGISTER READING
//     RESTATED IN INTEGERS: a min-max of the fills. Nothing in it reads the average fill, and no wrap condition does
//     (an average of wrap rates is dominated by the worst class).
//  2. ON THIS BOX. The fills here are the leapfrog's (each mode weighted by 1 / (1 - kappa lambda / 4)) on the
//     side-8 grid, not E-FRC-0262's continuous-time, infinite-grid ones. Their balances, computed by the model: axis
//     0.98425, diagonal 0.52836 (per T / s); n_P = 1 0.40126, n_P = 2 0.25345 (per T / f); worst-register balance
//     0.40769, average 0.45946 (1.7 and 0.4 percent below 0.4146386 and 0.4613818). Lag-one correlations: axis 0.7036,
//     diagonal 0.7289, n_P = 1 0.7323, n_P = 2 0.7149.
//  3. THE GAUSSIAN WRAP MODEL (bivariate normal per class, variance and lag-one correlation from point 2, seam at
//     D + 1/2): rho* = 0.40497 at z = 3 and 0.40669 at z = 4; R(0.4146386) = 1.118 and 1.176, R(0.4613818) = 1.854 and
//     2.874. So the condition is predicted to separate the two candidates (ln R moves by 0.51 and 0.89 between them)
//     and to pick the worst-register side, landing 2.3 and 1.9 percent below 0.4146386, at the box's own worst-
//     register balance. The axis links and the n_P = 1 triangles carry the worst wraps at every split scanned; the
//     diagonal links and n_P = 2 triangles wrap 16 to 1,300 times less.
//  4. WHAT A PASS WOULD AND WOULD NOT MEAN: by point 1, the condition picks the worst register because it IS the
//     worst-register statistic; it does not show that the light must keep its most-filled register inside its range,
//     which is the physical premise the route adds. The route can fail only if the carried light's wraps do not
//     follow its fills (non-Gaussian seams, heating by the carries) so that both splits wrap alike.
//
// PROBES BEFORE THE GATES, DISCLOSED. tmp/sw-probe1.ts (tmp/sw-probe1.log): the box built from husk-balance's symbol
// equals the trit bulk's side-8 husk triangles (10,240, with n_P); the Gaussian model of points 2 and 3 (every number
// there is from this probe, before any gate was written); the carried splits chosen (0.4144620 = 5577 / 13456 at q =
// 49764 and 0.4616719 = 1331 / 2883 at q = 11253; the null control's second representations 0.4148485 and 0.4609091);
// timing (the Gibbs start 0.44 s, 500 beats 0.49 s). No wrap of the carried light was counted or printed before the
// gate run.
//
// HYPOTHESES AND GATES, fixed before the gate run, never moved.
//  I1 INSTRUMENT: (a) the side-8 box built from the symbol has exactly the trit bulk's husk triangles and n_P (the
//     Gibbs modes are this box's modes); (b) from the z = 3 start at both candidate splits, 100 beats forward and 100
//     inverse return every register and counter exactly, and after the forward beats B equals bal(C W x); (c) the
//     divergence of e modulo N is unchanged at every dock at every beat of every husk run; (d) on every husk run the
//     measured class variances (over all beats) are within 10 percent of the model's (T / s) a_h + 1/12 on links and
//     (T / f) b_t + sum w^2 / 12 on triangles (the rounding of the start).
//  C1 CONTROL, the instrument reads equal wraps where the two sides are alike: the massless ring (E-FRC-0236's closed
//     ladder: one link class, one plaquette class, 4,096 squares, B_p = x_p - x_(p+1)), whose link and plaquette
//     registers have identical Gibbs statistics at rho = 1. At the carried split nearest 1, R is within [0.8, 1.25]
//     at both temperatures (z fixed by the ring's own link variance at rho = 1), and at the split nearest 1.1127, R >=
//     1.3 at both (the other outcome).
//  C0 NULL SPREAD (read, enters P1): the average split in its second representation with Weyl stream 2; delta(z) =
//     |ln R(second) - ln R(first)|.
//  G1 THE DERIVATION (point 3): (i) at both candidate splits and both temperatures, every class with at least 100
//     wraps has a measured rate within a factor 1.5 of the bivariate-Gaussian crossing from its own measured variance
//     and lag-one correlation; (ii) the measured rho* is within 3 percent of the model's at each z.
//  H1 THE ROUTE: at both temperatures R crosses 1 exactly once on the scan, at a rho* on the worst-register side of
//     the geometric midpoint 0.43737 (nearer 0.4146386 than 0.4613818 in ln), and the largest class wrap rate at the
//     worst-register split is below the one at the average split.
//  P1 THE FALSIFIER (the route's kill): at either temperature |ln R(0.4613818) - ln R(0.4146386)| <= max(0.05,
//     3 delta(z)): both splits wrap alike.
// READ: per class wrap rates, variances and lag-one correlations at every split; R and the largest class rate along
// the scan (the min-max split of the scan); the first and second halves' axis-link rates (heating by the carries);
// wraps per register class in the trit-rule sense of E-FRC-0265 (fraction of link-beats past the seam is 0 by
// construction here).
// VERDICT: fail if P1 fires or I1 or C1 fails; pass if I1, C1, G1 and H1 hold and P1 does not; partial otherwise.
//
// WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT SHOW. Exact: the carried light's integer dynamics (a bijection, Gauss modulo N) and its
// wrap counts on one Weyl start per temperature. Floats: the Gibbs start before rounding, the model and the Gaussian
// crossing integrals. It can show whether the integer condition separates the two candidates on the classical
// carried light with both seams, and which one it lies nearer. It cannot show that the light's split is fixed by the
// condition (point 4), it does not run the quantum light (OPEN-LGT-12), the start is one quasi-random Gibbs draw per
// temperature, and its rho* is the side-8, kappa = 1/33 box's, not the infinite husk's.
//
// Depth L2: the model's light run as integers with counted wraps, with a float Gibbs start and a Gaussian model.
