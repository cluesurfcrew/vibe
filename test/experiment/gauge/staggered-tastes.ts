// HOW MANY SPECIES OF ONE HAND DOES ONE ORIENTATION CLASS CARRY? (E-FRC-0285). The route "count the tastes" (roadmap
// routes/matter-forces-numbers.md, G · chirality without fermion doubling): the two classes of E-FRC-0274 are a Kogut-
// Susskind staggered split; count the species per class at k = 0 and the doublers at the zone corners, by an exact band
// count on a side-4 box. Kill: more than one species of a hand per class.
//
// WHAT IS RUN. E-FRC-0274 found that each class runs a label rule: on the class that starts on e = +1 docks the
// orientation-reading mass is [S(u+, u-)], [D(u-, u+)] (half + meets u+ then conj(u-), half - meets u- then conj(u+)),
// on the other class its mirror, and that each class's band is the flat cycle's (its gate F). So a class's species are
// the band minima of that cycle over the D4 zone. This file counts them (u+ = ringUnit(-1, 4), u- = ringUnit(2, 2),
// E-FRC-0258's pair): exactly from the closed form of the Clifford hop, on the side-4 box (128 momenta), on side 6 and on
// side 12 (where every zero lies), and on the side-4 box again from the cycle's own levels for both classes and both
// halves.
//
// DERIVED BEFORE THE GATE RUN.
// 1. THE BAND (E-SPN-0160, E-FRC-0274 item 5). On each half the moving levels solve l^2 - (a + b + (a - 1)(b - 1) mu) l +
//    a b = 0 with mu = |s(K)|^2 / 4, s(K) = sum_r r sin(K . r) / sqrt 288, the naive lattice Dirac hop on the D4 roots
//    (E-SPN-0180's covariant Clifford hop in the trivial field). The rest level of a half is the root at mu = 0, so a
//    half has a species at every zero of s, all of one mass: the lightest level sits at mu = 0 and nowhere else.
// 2. THE ZEROS, EXACTLY. Summing the 24 roots r = +-e_i +- e_j, s_i = (4 / sqrt 288) sin K_i sum_{j != i} cos K_j. So
//    s = 0 needs, for each i, sin K_i = 0 or sum_{j != i} cos K_j = 0. Cases: (a) every K_i in {0, pi}: 16 points; (b) no
//    sin zero: all cos equal and 3 cos = 0, every K_i = +-pi/2: 16; (c) one K_i = 0 or pi (cos eps) and the other three
//    with cos = -eps / 2, so +-2 pi/3 or +-pi/3: 4 x 2 x 8 = 64; (d) two with cos of opposite sign 1 and -1 and two at
//    +-pi/2: 6 x 2 x 4 = 48 (two with cos equal, or three, is impossible: an odd sum of +-1 is not 0). 144 points in
//    [-pi, pi)^4; the D4 zone identifies K with K + pi (1, 1, 1, 1), which maps each case onto itself, so 72 species per
//    half per class, all isolated, 8 of them at the zone corners (k = 0 and 7 corner doublers). Each is a nondegenerate
//    Dirac point: the Jacobian of s is diagonal at (a) with entries eps_i (sum of three eps), odd, never 0, and at (b) is
//    -(sigma sigma^T - diag) with eigenvalues 3, -1, -1, -1 up to sign; (c), (d) checked in the run. By Nielsen and
//    Ninomiya the signs of the Jacobian determinants (the species' chiralities) sum to 0: 36 and 36. PREDICTED.
// 3. ON THE SIDE-4 BOX the momenta are multiples of pi/2, so cases (a), (b), (d) appear and (c) does not: (16 + 16 + 48)
//    / 2 = 40 species per half per class among the 128 momenta (1 at k = 0, 7 at the other corners, 8 of type (b), 24 of
//    type (d)), the box's 160 = 40 x 4 zeros of mu read by E-FRC-0284's probe. On side 6 (multiples of pi/3): (a) and (c),
//    (16 + 64) / 2 = 40. On side 12 all four: 72. On the husk slice K = (q, 0) of E-SPN-0167, read only: 28 (8 at the
//    cubic corners, Kogut and Susskind's 2^3, and 20 more).
// 4. WHY THE CLASS DOES NOT STAGGER. Kogut and Susskind's sign thins the naive fermion by spin-diagonalizing it: one
//    component a site, so 2^d doublers become 2^(d/2) tastes. E-FRC-0274's sign is a pure-gauge checkerboard on the true
//    mesh (holonomy +1 on every loop) and leaves each class running the full 192-mode label rule, so it removes no mode
//    and no doubler. PREDICTED: the route's hypothesis fails and its kill fires, by 72 to 1 in the zone and 40 to 1 on
//    the box.
//
// PROBES BEFORE THE GATES, disclosed. tmp/tt-probe1.log (float zeros of the closed form): 40 zeros on sides 4, 6 and 8,
//  72 on sides 12 and 24, 8 at the corners each time, every |det| at least 1 in units of (4 / sqrt 288)^4 (none
//  degenerate); Jacobian signs 4 + / 36 - on sides 4 and 8, 36 + / 4 - on side 6, 36 / 36 on 12 and 24; husk slice 20 on
//  side 4, 28 on sides 12 and 24 (8 corners). tmp/tt-probe2.log: on six box momenta the class A cycle's 8 moving levels
//  per half match the law to 6.8e-15, sit 4 + 4 at the rest roots at the zeros (0, 0, 0, 0) and (0, 0, pi, 0) and
//  0.07 to 0.46 from them elsewhere; 0.2 s per half. tmp/tt-smoke.log: the exact counters of this file alone (no cycle):
//  box 40 = (a) 8 + (b) 8 + (d) 24, side 6 40 = (a) 8 + (c) 32, side 12 72, 8 corners each, signs as the float probe, 0
//  degenerate; husk slice 20 and 28; the Wilson-shifted hop 1 and 1. No gate was set after the gate run.
//
// HYPOTHESES AND GATES, fixed before the gate run.
//  I1 INSTRUMENT: at all 128 box momenta, for both class rules and both halves, the cycle has exactly 8 moving levels per
//     half and they match the two roots of item 1 at mu = |s(K)|^2 / 4 within 1e-10, 4 on each.
//  C1 CONTROL (the counter can read one species): the same exact zero counter on a Wilson-shifted hop, mu_W = |s|^2 / 4
//     + w^2 with w = sum_r (1 - cos K . r) / 48 (zero only on the reciprocal lattice), finds exactly 1 zero on the side-4
//     box and 1 on side 12; and the cycle-level counter reads a nonzero distance (at least 1e-3) from the rest roots at
//     every box momentum with mu > 0.
//  D1 DERIVED, EXACT (integers on the box, Z[sqrt 3] on sides 6 and 12): zeros of s on the box 40, split (a) 8, (b) 8,
//     (d) 24 by type, 8 at the corners; side 6: 40; side 12: 72, 8 at the corners; every zero nondegenerate (Jacobian
//     determinant nonzero, exactly), signs 36 + and 36 - on side 12. The cycle count on the box: the levels of each half
//     sit 4 + 4 at the rest roots (1e-10) at exactly the 40 zero momenta, for both classes and both halves.
//  H1 THE ROUTE'S HYPOTHESIS: one species of a hand per class, that is, a half of a class reaches its rest level at one
//     momentum of the zone only. Predicted to FAIL.
//  P1 FALSIFIER (the route's kill): a half of a class reaches its rest level at more than one momentum of the box.
// READ, gating nothing: the husk slice count on sides 4 and 12, with corners and signs.
// VERDICT: fail (the route dies, as derived) if P1 fires with I1 and C1 holding; pass if H1 holds with I1 and C1;
// partial otherwise (an instrument or control miss, or D1 missing with P1 undecided).
//
// WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT SHOW. It counts the band minima of the class rule in momentum space on the flat D4 box, the
// reading E-FRC-0274's gate F used for a class; it cannot read momentum on the true hyperbolic mesh, where the classes
// live, and it reads one member with no link field. A species here is a band minimum of one register half at the rest
// level; each is a massive Dirac point carrying 4 + 4 levels. It does not say whether a piece the rule does not yet have
// (a Wilson term, E-SPN-0168's mixers on one half, an overlap operator) removes the doublers, only that the class split
// does not.
//
// FIRST RUN 2026-10-02 (tmp/tt-run1.log, 55 s): NO VERDICT. The run crashed in the instrument before returning: code/
//  algebra/linear/complex-eigen threw "QR iteration did not converge" inside code/measure/orientation-taste's
//  halfBandEigenvalues, which diagonalizes the 192 x 192 matrix U P (96 exact zeros from the projector, 88 levels at 1).
//  No gate was read and nothing was printed. A diagnostic (tmp/tt-diag.log, failure locations only) found three of the
//  512 solves failing, all in class B: momentum 17 (0, pi, 0, pi/2) half -, 109 (3 pi/2, pi/2, pi, pi/2) half + and 113
//  (3 pi/2, pi, 0, pi/2) half +. THE INSTRUMENT DEFECT, FIXED AFTER THE RUN: the levels are now read from the unitary
//  96 x 96 block b^T U b on the half (halfBlockLevels below), which has no cluster of zeros; tmp/tt-fixcheck.log shows it
//  returns the 8 moving levels at the three failing momenta (counts only, no gate read). No gate, tolerance or threshold
//  was changed. Under the protocol's one gate run this file has NOT been run again: its gates are unread, and a second
//  run, recorded as such, is left to the program's decision. The exact counts the gates would read are in the probes
//  above (tmp/tt-probe1.log, tmp/tt-smoke.log), which are probes, not a gate run.
//
// SECOND RUN 2026-10-02 (tmp/tt-run2.log, 14 s), run by the coordinating session after the crash, disclosed: the
//  first run read no gate, and the instrument was fixed (halfBlockLevels) with no gate or threshold moved. FAIL as
//  derived: I1, C1, D1 hold, H1 false, P1 true. The Clifford hop's exact zeros number 40 on the side-4 box ((a) 8 + (b)
//  8 + (d) 24, 8 at the corners, Jacobian signs 4 + / 36 -), 40 on side 6 and 72 on side 12 (36 + / 36 -), and the
//  cycle's levels in every class and half sit exactly on that zero set (40 each, 8 at the corners). So each orientation
//  class carries 40 species on the box, far more than one of a hand: the route's kill fires. Read: the husk slice holds
//  20 (side 4) and 28 (side 12). A Wilson-shifted hop leaves 1 zero (the control).
