// ARE COMPOSITE SOURCES BAND-MIXED? (E-GRV-0152, OPEN-GRV-02, route H2c in ledger H "the equivalence principle"). Under
// the register count gravity acts as two fields, one per band: a hole feels only its own band's sector count
// (E-GRV-0147), so a band-A hole at rest sources (sigma_S, sigma_D) = (1, 0), a band-B hole (0, 1), and a hole of the
// other band hardly falls toward it (at most 0.082 of the like pull). As a lapse both bands fall alike, and at rest the
// principle is R = 1 (E-GRV-0149). The route H2c: every physical source is a composite, and if composites carry equal S
// and D weight the two fields average to one on any real source, so the failure would belong to bare holes only. The
// row's test: read the S and D weights of the register meson (E-SPN-0162) and the light pair (E-SPN-0173), then the
// cross-band pull toward each. Kill: the composite band weights differ by more than 10%, or the cross-band pull toward a
// composite stays under 0.5.
//
// WHAT IS RUN. (1) The two composites' levels, rebuilt with their own engines (code/measure/register-meson, register-
// coulomb) on balls smaller than their gate runs (the machine's budget, below). (2) Their sector counts at each beat's
// stage, read with exact projectors (code/measure/register-band-weights, new): sigma_S, the pair's weight in Q_S on
// either member at the start of beat 1, and sigma_D, its weight in the carried partner sector T D at the start of beat
// 2, the two counts E-GRV-0146's piece is sourced by. (3) The pull of a band-A and a band-B hole toward a static source
// with those counts, on E-GRV-0147's slab (side 40 by 2, r 10, sigma 3, 8 cycles), with the same engine and the same
// reading (packetRun, the mean offset against the free packet).
//
// DERIVED BEFORE THE GATE RUN.
// 1. THE PROJECTORS. A member in W is S a + T D b; its S part is S (a + C b) and its T D part T D (b + C^dag a), C the
//    overlap of register-meson. On the pair blocks (A = S S, B = S TD, X = TD S, D = TD TD) Q_S on member 1 keeps A + C1 X
//    and B + C1 D, Q_D on member 1 keeps X + C1^dag A and D + C1^dag B, and member 2 alike with C2 (register-band-
//    weights). These are orthogonal projectors in the Gram metric up to the ball's edge. The engines' beats are functions
//    of them: beat 1 = 1 + (u - 1)(Q_S1 + Q_S2) + beta1(V) Q_S1 Q_S2, beat 2 the same with conj u, Q_D and beta2; the light
//    pair's cycle adds the S D and D S cross pieces after beat 2. So the counts are read on the level itself (sigma_S)
//    and on the level after beat 1 built from the projectors (sigma_D). The counts of a pair of HOLES are those of its
//    missing orbitals, so the hole composite with these orbitals carries the same (sigma_S, sigma_D); the reading does not
//    depend on whether the composite is read as members or as holes (only the sign of the piece does, E-GRV-0146).
// 2. WHY THE COMPOSITES SHOULD BE BAND-PURE. A pair level is an eigenvector of the cycle at one phase. Free, the pair
//    bands are S S near 2M (both members band A), D D near -2M (both band B), and S D within the S D width of 0 (E-SPN-
//    0162 point 2). The meson's string acts on S S and D D only, and its level sits at 1.979, in the S S well; the light
//    pair's level at 2M - E_b, below the S S threshold. Each member is then a band-A state spread over the momenta of the
//    bound wave, with s = 1 at rest falling as it moves (E-GRV-0147 G2), and with d = 1 - s for a band state. So sigma_S
//    is near 2 and sigma_D is the members' moving share plus whatever the binding mixes in, far from equal. PREDICTED:
//    sigma_D / sigma_S under 0.1 for both. The D D level (the meson's mirror, at -E_L) is the same with S and D exchanged.
// 3. THE CROSS-BAND PULL. A band-A hole at rest takes the angle phi sigma_S on its S unit and a band-B hole phi sigma_D on
//    its D unit (E-GRV-0147 point 5), so to first order the pulls are P_A = sigma_S L + sigma_D X and P_B = sigma_D L +
//    sigma_S X, L the like pull of a unit source (2.174e-2) and X the cross pull (1.2e-3 at cycle 8). PREDICTED: the
//    cross-band ratio min(P_A, P_B) / max(P_A, P_B) under 0.2 for both composites, and near 1 for a band-mixed (1, 1)
//    source.
//
// PROBES BEFORE THE GATES, disclosed (tmp/bm-probe1.ts, .log; no gate written before them, none moved after).
//  The projector beats reproduce the meson cycle (radius 4, generic start) to 1.0e-15 and the light pair's vector cycle
//  with its cross pieces (radius 5) to 8.3e-16. Speeds on this shared machine: meson radius 7, 1.23 s a cycle, radius 9
//  3.30 s; light pair radius 14, 2.81 s, radius 16, 4.47 s. So the gate runs cannot rebuild E-SPN-0162's radius-9 level
//  with filters 64, 256, 1024 or E-SPN-0173's radius-16 a_B 3.5 level with 128, 512, 2048 in the half hour a run is
//  allowed. The meson on radius 7 (filters 64, 128 at 2.005 then the read phase): E 1.970, 1.931, residual 9.0e-2,
//  3.2e-2; sigma_S 1.830, 1.847, sigma_D 0.128, 0.119 (each member 0.923 and 0.060); coordinate block shares 0.852,
//  0.071, 0.071, 0.007. The light pair at a_B 3 on radius 10 (filter 128): E 1.5714, residual 3.4e-2, sigma_S 1.969,
//  sigma_D 0.036, the projector check 5e-6 (the ball's edge). These set the plan below: the meson on radius 7, the light
//  pair at E-SPN-0173's stronger point a_B 3 (its clean level, residual 1.25e-4 there) on radius 12, and gates loose
//  enough for levels with percent residuals, which the 10% question allows.
//
// HYPOTHESES AND GATES, fixed before the gate run.
//  H1 (the route): for both composites the band weights agree within 10%, |sigma_S - sigma_D| <= 0.1 (sigma_S +
//     sigma_D) / 2, AND the cross-band pull toward each is at least 0.5 of its like-band pull. PREDICTED: FAILS on both
//     parts (sigma_D / sigma_S about 0.065 for the meson and 0.02 for the light pair; cross ratios under 0.2).
//  P1 (the falsifier, the row's kill): for either composite the weights differ by more than 10%, or the cross ratio is
//     under 0.5. PREDICTED: FIRES.
//  I1 (instrument): the projector-built cycle equals each engine's cycle on a generic Weyl start within 1e-12; on each
//     level the projector check |<psi|Q psi> - <Q psi|Q psi>| is at most 1e-5 of the norm (the ball's edge); each level's
//     residual is at most 5e-2, and its sigma_S and sigma_D move by at most 0.02 between the last two filters; every
//     slab packet keeps its norm within 1e-10, and the free packets' drift is under 0.01 of the like pull.
//  C1 (control: the weight reader can read the other band): the meson engine's D D start (the meson's profile in the D
//     block), filtered 64 cycles at minus the meson's level, reads sigma_D > 1.1 sigma_S.
//  C2 (control: the pull reader can read the outcome that saves the route): a band-mixed source (1, 1) gives a cross
//     ratio of at least 0.5, while a band-A hole's source (1, 0) gives under 0.2 (E-GRV-0147's two fields).
//  READ, gating nothing: each member's s and d, sigma_S + sigma_D against 2, the levels' phases against E-SPN-0162's
//  1.978945 and E-SPN-0173's 1.568, the pulls against the first-order form of point 3.
// VERDICT: fail if P1 fires and I1, C1, C2 hold (the route closed); partial if I1, C1 or C2 fails (the reading not
//  trusted); pass if H1 holds with I1, C1 and C2.
//
// FIRST RUN 2026-10-02 (tmp/bm-run1.log, 1,101 s): PARTIAL, on one instrument clause; the route's kill fires on both
//  composites, as predicted. No gate moved and none was rerun.
//  - I1 FAILS on the meson's stability: its sigma_S and sigma_D moved by 0.082 and 0.068 between the 64 and 192 filters
//    (1.830 to 1.912, 0.128 to 0.060) against the 0.02 allowed, so the radius-7 level with residual 3.5e-2 is not
//    converged and its counts are read to about 0.1 only. Every other clause holds: the projector beats reproduce both
//    engines to 7.7e-16 and 6.8e-16, the projector checks 1.6e-8 and 7.5e-8, residuals 3.5e-2 and 2.1e-2, the light
//    pair's counts moved 5.7e-3, slab norms kept to 6e-12, the free drift 7.3e-6.
//  - P1 FIRES, H1 fails on all four parts. The meson (E 1.9503 against E-SPN-0162's 1.978945 on radius 9): sigma_S
//    1.912 (0.956 a member), sigma_D 0.060 (0.030 a member), D over S 0.031; band-A pull 3.21e-2, band-B 2.41e-3, cross
//    ratio 0.075. The light pair (a_B 3, E 1.5656 against E-SPN-0173's 1.5685 on radius 14): sigma_S 1.978 (0.989),
//    sigma_D 0.027 (0.013), D over S 0.013; pulls 3.25e-2 and 1.63e-3, cross ratio 0.050. Both are band-A pairs: the
//    weights differ by a factor 30 and 74 where the route needs 10%, and the other band is pulled at 5 to 8% of the
//    like band, near a bare band-A hole's 5.7%. The meson's ratio, the less converged, would have to move by a factor 7
//    to reach 0.5.
//  - C1: the D D start reads sigma_S 0.145, sigma_D 1.817 (E -1.925): the reader reads either band. C2: a (1, 1) source
//    pulls both bands 1.786e-2 (ratio 1.0000000), a (1, 0) source 2.174e-2 and 1.23e-3 (ratio 0.057, E-GRV-0147's).
//  - Read: sigma_S + sigma_D is 1.972 (meson) and 2.004 (light pair), not exactly 2; the pulls are sublinear in the
//    counts (the first-order form of point 3 gives 4.16e-2 and 4.30e-2 for the like pulls, read 3.21e-2 and 3.25e-2;
//    the (1, 1) source 1.79e-2 against 2.30e-2), which does not touch the ratios' order.
//  So a composite of members of one band sources one band's field: the meson and the light pair are band-pure to 3% and
//  1%, and the two fields do not average on them. Route H2c is closed for the composites the rule holds; an S D pair (one
//  member of each band) is the composite left that would carry about (1, 1), and none is held.
//
// WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT SHOW. It reads the two composites the row names, as levels of their own engines on smaller
// balls, in the test-particle limit of the pull (a static source with the composite's counts, one hole probe), as
// E-GRV-0147 did. It can close the route for these composites: a band-pure composite cannot average the two fields. It
// cannot rule out some other composite with equal weights (an S D pair, one member of each band, would carry about (1,
// 1)), and it says nothing about the lapse form of gravity (E-GRV-0149), where both bands already fall alike.
//
// Depth L2 (levels of two-body quantum walks in floats, read with exact projectors; the slab kernel is the depth
// register's float stand-in). DETERMINISM: no random numbers; placed starts, filtered levels, Weyl values. NOTHING
// MOVES: the pieces act inside a dock and the stream takes each slot's value one dock along.
