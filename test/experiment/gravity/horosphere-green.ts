// THE BULK'S OWN GREEN'S FUNCTION ON THE HUSK (E-GRV-0150, OPEN-GRV-01, OPEN-GRV-12, routes H3b, I11a, I12b). Route H3b
// asks whether Newton's 1/r is the bulk mesh's own harmonic function: content sources a massless field on the true
// {3,4,3,4} mesh, read on the cusp horosphere (the husk), as a brane in a hyperbolic bulk localizes gravity (Karch and
// Randall 2001). The same solve answers I11a (a power law on the horosphere, r^(-2 Delta), whose Delta would be the
// ripples' tilt) and I12b (an l = 4 cubic pattern that falls as (k b)^2). The routes file names the kill in advance:
// "it falls faster than 1/r past r = 10 (a massive brane mode), or 0.549 does not come out".
//
// WHAT IS SOLVED. The graph Laplacian 24 - A of the mesh's cells (24 facets each, E-GMT-0027), its inverse G read
// between husk cells, G(r) for a husk offset r in the husk's cubic lattice. The cells below the husk are taken modulo
// the cusp's cubic translations (code/measure/cusp-green buildCuspQuotient), so G(r) is the inverse transform of one
// Bloch solve per husk momentum k, N^3 momenta, of which only the cubic wedge is solved. The mesh is cut at a floor,
// a Busemann level (the husk is level 1, every center at an odd level, E-CSM-0060):
//  DIRICHLET: a link below the floor ends on a cell held at 0. As the floor deepens, G rises to the infinite mesh's
//    minimal Green's function (fewer paths are removed), which is what "the bulk's own Green's function" names.
//  REFLECTING: the truncated graph's own Laplacian, nothing crosses the floor: a finite bulk ending on a second wall.
//    It has a zero mode, so G_husk(k) -> 1 / (K k^2) and G(r) -> 1 / (4 pi K r), K the husk-axis stiffness,
//    computed exactly by second-order perturbation of the zero mode (cusp-green stiffness). The husk alone has K = 1.
//
// DERIVED BEFORE THE GATE RUN.
// 1. THE HUSK IS THE TOP OF THE MESH. Each husk cell touches the cusp; its 6 husk facets meet its husk neighbours and
//    its other 18 lead down (E-SPN-0184's 18 down slots). Nothing lies above. In the upper half-space picture with the
//    cusp at infinity, a cell at level l has height about 1/l, so its horizontal size in husk units is about 1/l:
//    the deeper a cell, the smaller its horizontal step. The hyperbolic geodesic between two husk points rises toward
//    the cusp, through the husk cells' own interiors, which the graph collapses into one step per husk spacing.
// 2. LEMMA (exact once its input is measured): if a link whose shallower end is at level l moves each horizontal
//    coordinate by at most 1/l, every link moves each coordinate by at most 1, so a path between husk cells at offset
//    r has at least |r|_inf steps. With G = sum_n A^n / 24^(n+1), (A^n)_{0r} = 0 for n < |r|_inf, and the infinite
//    graph's adjacency norm is 24 rho with rho < 1 (the mesh is non-amenable, Kesten 1959), G(r) <= rho^|r|_inf /
//    (24 (1 - rho)). So G falls exponentially along the husk: no power law, a massive brane mode. The bulk acts as a
//    sink: a husk walker steps down with probability 18/24 and the transient bulk rarely returns it.
// 3. THE SCALE. If the bulk never returned a walker, the husk would be the cubic lattice with operator 24 - A, whose
//    axis decay is e^(-mu0 r) with cosh(mu0) = 10, mu0 = 2.9932 per dock. Returns lower the effective mass, so the
//    true decay is somewhat slower. The cubic lattice decays faster along a body diagonal than along an axis per unit
//    Euclidean length, so the anisotropy does not fall with r: it grows.
// 4. THE REFLECTING FLOOR. A zero mode makes the husk's static field 1/r at long range with strength 1/K. Each odd
//    level adds about l^2 cells per window with horizontal steps about 1/l, so each level adds about one unit of
//    stiffness, and K grows without bound with the floor: Newton's coupling 1/(4 pi K) of a finite bulk falls as one
//    over its depth, and vanishes for the infinite mesh, where the Dirichlet reading holds.
//
// PROBES BEFORE THE GATES, DISCLOSED (tmp/hg-probe1.ts to tmp/hg-probe4.ts, under 30 s each). The quotient at floors 9,
//  17, 33: 0 missing neighbours, 0 inconsistent steps, window counts per level equal to E-CSM-0060's, and the largest
//  horizontal step at level l exactly 1/l. Dirichlet G on N = 16 at floors 9 and 17: G(0) 0.04358, G(1,0,0) 1.926e-3,
//  G(2,0,0) 8.58e-5, axis ratios about 22 a dock, G(1,1,1) 2.25e-5, G(2,2,2) 2.92e-8, floors 9 and 17 within 1 percent
//  at r = 8 (whose value carried a periodic image at N = 16). The control (24 - A on the cubic lattice, N = 32)
//  against the Bessel integral: 2e-15 relative at r <= 4, 3.5e-6 at (8,0,0), the transform's float floor. The
//  reflecting stiffness: K 1 at floor 1 (the husk alone), 5.9966 at floor 9 (direct solve at k = 2 pi / 512 within
//  3.4e-5), 20.229 at floor 33. So P1, P2 and P3 below were seen at small size, and H2's ratio was set from floors 9
//  and 33 (K over the number of levels 1.199 and 1.190). The gate run extends to N = 32 and floors 17 and 49, which the
//  probes did not run, and holds the routes to their own words.
//
// HYPOTHESES AND GATES, fixed before the gate run, never moved.
//  I1 INSTRUMENT: every quotient (floors 1, 9, 17, 33, 49) has 0 missing in-range neighbours, 0 inconsistent steps and
//     every level an integer, and its window counts per level equal E-CSM-0060's (1, 12, 30, 56, 108, 132, 182, 360,
//     306, 380, 672, 552, 750, 972, 870, 992, 1584 to level 33); the largest horizontal step times the shallower level
//     is 1 to 1e-9 at every level (the lemma's input); every Bloch solve's true residual is under 1e-12 and its
//     imaginary part under 1e-12; six momenta off the wedge, permuted and negated, give the wedge value to 1e-10
//     relative; the Bloch transform on N = 4 at floor 9 equals a direct solve on the unfolded 4^3 periodic box at
//     all 64 husk offsets to 1e-10 relative; at floor 9 the stiffness from perturbation and from a direct reflecting
//     solve at k = 2 pi / 512 agree to 1e-3 relative.
//  C1 CONTROL: the same transform on the cubic lattice with operator 24 - A (the husk with an absorbing bulk) equals
//     the Bessel integral to 1e-8 relative at (0,0,0) to (6,0,0), (1,1,0), (1,1,1), (2,2,2), and to 1e-4 at (8,0,0).
//  F1 FLOOR: Dirichlet G at the axis offsets 0 to 8 and at (1,1,1), (2,2,2) agrees between floors 33 and 49 to 1e-3
//     relative (the floor has stopped mattering on the offsets read).
//  H1 THE ROUTE (H3b as written): along the husk axis r G(r) does not fall from r = 4 to r = 8 (the field falls no
//     faster than 1/r), at floor 49.
//  P1 THE FALSIFIER (point 2): every axis decay rate mu(r) = ln(G(r) / G(r + 1)) for r = 1 to 7 is at least 2. A power
//     law r^(-p) would give mu(7) = p ln(8/7), under 2 for any p below 15, and I11a's slow falloff (Delta near 0) far
//     less. P1 kills H3b and I11a together.
//  P2 (I12b): the decay rate per unit Euclidean length along the body diagonal, ln(G(2,2,2) / G(4,4,4)) / (2 sqrt 3),
//     and along the axis, ln(G(4,0,0) / G(8,0,0)) / 4, differ by more than 10 percent: the cubic pattern does not fall
//     as (k b)^2 on the offsets read.
//  P3 (H3b's number): 1 / K at the floor of four levels below the husk (floor 9, the depth of E-GRV-0100's stack) is
//     not within 5 percent of E-GRV-0100's 0.549.
//  H2 THE REFLECTING FLOOR (point 4): K rises strictly through floors 1, 9, 17, 33, 49, and K(49) / K(17) is within
//     10 percent of 25 / 9, the ratio of the number of levels (one unit of stiffness a level, near 1.19).
// VERDICT, fixed before the run: FAIL (as derived) when I1, C1, F1 and P1 hold (H3b and I11a fail: a massive brane
//  mode); PASS when I1, C1, F1 and H1 hold; PARTIAL otherwise. P2, P3 and H2 are reported and do not move the status.
// WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT SHOW. It reads the graph Laplacian of the true mesh, the simplest massless field on it; it
//  does not run the rule. A fail rules out the bulk's own harmonic function as Newton's kernel on this mesh, with the
//  husk as the cusp layer; it does not touch the depth register (E-GRV-0090, 0148), which is an added piece, nor a
//  field with a different kinetic term. The reflecting reading shows what a bulk with a floor would give, not that the
//  mesh has one.
//
// FIRST RUN 2026-10-02 (tmp/hg-grv-run1.log, 88 s): PARTIAL, every gate as registered, none moved or rerun. I1 missed
//  on one check: the direct reflecting solve at k = 2 pi / 512 (the stiffness cross-check) ended with a true residual
//  of 3.7e-11 against its 1e-12 gate, on a value of 1107, so 3e-14 of it, the float floor of a solve near a zero mode
//  (tmp/hg-probe5.ts, after the run). Its answer agrees with the perturbative K to 3.5e-5. Every other I1 check held:
//  the quotients exact at floors 1 to 49 (25,083 cells a husk cell at 49), the lemma's input 1 to 2.9e-12 at every
//  level, every Bloch residual under 1e-12, the off-wedge momenta equal to 0, the 4^3 box against the transform to
//  6.0e-12, the stiffness solves' residuals under 1e-12. C1 8.4e-9 (tight) and 3.5e-6 (at 8), F1 2.3e-4. H1 fails and
//  P1 holds: G along the axis 0.04359, 1.927e-3, 8.583e-5, 3.854e-6, 1.744e-7, 7.95e-9, 3.65e-10, 1.69e-11, 7.89e-13,
//  decay rates 3.111 falling to 3.066 a dock (the local power exponent climbs 4.5, 7.7, 10.8, ... 23.0), a brane mode
//  of length 0.325 docks against the absorbing husk's 0.334, so the bulk's returns lower the mass by 3 percent. P2: per
//  unit length 3.682 along the diagonal against 3.077 along the axis, 20 percent apart. P3: the four-level share 1/K is
//  0.1668. H2: K 1, 5.997, 10.701, 20.229, 29.823 at floors 1, 9, 17, 33, 49, K(49)/K(17) 2.787 against 2.778, about
//  1.19 a level. Dirichlet G(0) 0.0435817, 0.0435918, 0.0435925 at floors 17, 33, 49.
//
//  A PROBE AFTER THE RUN (tmp/hd-probe1.ts, 193 s, gating nothing): the source moved off the husk to a cell at level 9
//  and at level 17 (floor 49, N = 32). G between the cell and its own lattice translates falls by the same factor, about
//  22 a dock (level 9: 2.96e-8, 1.33e-9, 5.78e-11, 3.0e-12 at r = 1 to 4; level 17: 7.09e-9, 3.16e-10, 1.45e-11), down
//  to the solve's floor near 1e-13. So a deep cell reaches a horizontal translate by climbing to the husk, crossing it and
//  coming back: the continuum's r^-6 (Delta = 3) could only appear between cells less than one husk spacing apart.
//
// Depth L1: exact linear algebra on the true mesh against a derived prediction; no rule is run.
// DETERMINISM: the mesh, its quotients and the momentum grid are fixed; no start, no random number.
