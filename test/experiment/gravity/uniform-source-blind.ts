// A UNIFORM SOURCE AND THE DEPTH (E-GRV-0153), route H12c (note/research/vibe/roadmap/routes/
// gravity-cosmos-heat-classical.md, H · the cosmological constant): "a Floquet rule has no vacuum energy: a cycle has a
// quasi-energy defined mod 2 pi and no ground state, so a uniform vacuum energy is not defined, and only departures source
// depth (discrete-gravity.md 5e: a uniform source sets the zero of depth)." Test, in the route's words: "show the depth
// field is blind to a uniform source on a closed box, exact". Kill: "a uniform source tilts the husk." OPEN-CSM-06.
//
// WHAT IS RUN. The bounded depth field of E-GRV-0090 (code/rule/step-depth: per husk link a line trit and a step, per
// dock a rate and a carried rest, the depth FOUND by summing steps, all integers), on a closed husk box (side 16
// periodic, 4,096 docks, D 16, three base-297 digits as E-GRV-0090), for 1,024 beats from rest. The rule reads its source
// only as the lines' divergence, so the source is passed here directly per dock (code/measure/sourced-depth sourcedBeat,
// stepBeat with Q^L rho in place of Q^L div f; I1 gates that they agree). A stand-in, as E-GRV-0090 is: what is read is
// what this depth register does with a uniform source, not whether the rule's own vacuum energy is uniform.
//
// DERIVED BEFORE THE GATE RUN.
// 1. THE LINES CANNOT HOLD IT. Every line adds +1 at its tail and -1 at its head, so on a closed box the divergence of any
//    line field sums to 0. A uniform content c != 0 sums to c N. So the lines, the only way the rule reads matter, cannot
//    carry a uniform source at all: on a closed box Gauss's law already says only departures from the mean have lines.
// 2. GIVEN DIRECTLY, IT MOVES ONLY THE RATE. With rho + c in place of rho, the beat's X = a (Q^L rho - div F) gains a Q^L c
//    at every dock. Q = 297 divides Q^L (L >= 1), so the floor gains exactly a Q^(L-1) c and the rest R is unchanged. So
//    the rate gains the same 2 c Q^(L-1) at every dock every beat, its difference between docks is unchanged, and the
//    step F (which changes by g times a difference of two rates) is unchanged bit for bit. The window does not spoil this:
//    where the uniform shift makes some rates wrap and not others, their difference changes by a multiple of the span, F's
//    raw value by g times it, and F's own wrap (the same span) removes it. So the steps, the rests and the found depth are
//    exactly the departure's, every beat, and the rate differs from it by t 2 c Q^(L-1) mod the span at every dock. The
//    uniform source moves the depth's zero (the uniform part of the depth grows as kappa c t^2 / 2, held nowhere, since
//    no register holds a depth) and tilts nothing. This holds for every integer c; for c a fraction of a content unit
//    whose a Q^L c is not a multiple of q, the floor depends on each dock's rest and the step can change (a read below).
// 3. THE CONTROL. A source of the same total N (mean 1) that is not uniform has a departure, and the departure has lines
//    and a static depth A x = rho - 1 (A the husk's g-weighted Laplacian, div F = A x). For the planar pair, +1 on the
//    plane x = 0 and -1 on the plane x = 8 over a uniform 1, the crossing count of a plane is 6 (the axis link, g = 2, and
//    four face diagonals), so -6 (x_(n+1) - 2 x_n + x_(n-1)) = rho - 1: the depth is a tent, x(0) - x(8) = 8 / 12 = 2/3.
//    The leapfrog from rest oscillates about the static depth, so the time average over 1,024 beats should be near it:
//    the slowest planar mode has omega = sqrt(kappa 6 (2 - 2 cos(2 pi / 16))) = 0.078 a beat, about 13 periods.
//
// PROBES BEFORE THE GATES, disclosed. tmp/us-probe1 (side 8, 256 beats, this file's code with PROBE_PLAN): I1, I2, I3, H1
//  exact on all six pairs (0 steps, rests, rates or depths off; the c = 50 runs' rates wrap 14,848 times); the sub-unit
//  read: on the zero base it changes no step (every dock's rest is the same), on the dip base it changes steps on
//  961,118 link-beats, by at most 70 register units (70 / 297^3 = 2.7e-6 of a whole step); the control: the uniform
//  source leaves 0 links tilted and a depth spread of 0, the dip, planes and slab tilt 4,240, 2,560 and 1,920 links,
//  the planar contrast 0.3272 against the side-8 static 1/3 (1.8 percent). It fixed STATIC_TOL at 5 percent. The F wrap
//  tallies of the C1 runs count the uniform rate's wraps passing through F (derived in 2), not slips.
//
// HYPOTHESES AND GATES, fixed before the gate run (sources: zero; the dip, +4 at (0,0,0) and -4 at (0,8,8); uniform c =
// 1, -2, 50 content units a dock, 50 chosen so the rates wrap):
//  I1 THE INSTRUMENT: the dip's placed lines (placeLines) have divergence equal to the dip on every dock, and stepBeat on
//     them equals sourcedBeat with Q^L div f bit for bit (step, rate, rest) on every one of the 1,024 beats.
//  I2 THE CLOSED BOX: the dip's lines and a fixed patterned line field ((7 l mod 3) - 1) have total divergence exactly
//     0, and placeLines refuses a uniform content of 1 on a side-4 box (no unit can be routed).
//  I3 the found depth has curl 0 in every H1 run.
//  H1 BLIND (the route's hypothesis): for both bases and all three c, the run with the uniform source added has the
//     base run's steps on every link and rests on every dock at every beat (0 off), its rate minus the base's equals
//     t 2 c Q^(L-1) mod the span at every dock and beat (0 off), and the same found depth at the end (0 docks off).
//  P1 THE KILL: any step, rest or found depth off in H1 (a uniform source tilts the husk). H1 fails exactly when P1 fires.
//  C1 THE CONTROL (the instrument can read a tilt): three sources of total N, 1 + the dip, 1 + the planar pair, and the
//     slab (2 on x < 8, 0 on x >= 8), each end with some nonzero step and a found-depth spread above 0, while the uniform
//     1 ends with every step 0 and spread 0; and the planar pair's time-averaged x(plane 0) - x(plane 8) is positive and
//     within 5 percent of the static 2/3.
// READ, gating nothing: the rate wraps of each H1 run; the sub-unit uniform source (one register unit a dock, 1 / Q^L of
// a content unit) on both bases, its step-beats off and largest step change; the controls' spreads, contrasts, wraps.
// VERDICT: fail if H1 fails (P1 fires); partial if H1 holds and I1, I2, I3 or C1 fails; pass otherwise.
//
// WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT SHOW. It can show that this depth register, the bounded stand-in on a closed box, cannot be
// sourced by a uniform density, exactly, at every beat: the uniform part of a source sets the zero of depth and runs it
// (a uniform depth acceleration that no register holds), and only departures tilt the husk. That is the route's
// mechanism for why a uniform vacuum energy does not gravitate here. It cannot show that the rule's vacuum energy is
// uniform (E-GRV-0106 found the vacuum's lines a fixed background of a trit, not proven uniform as a source), that the
// depth register is the rule's own (it is added by hand), nor anything about an open or growing mesh, where the box is
// not closed and the uniform part can have lines to the edge. It gives Λ no value: it says only that a constant vacuum
// density contributes zero, so Λ must come from elsewhere (H12a, H12b).
//
// FIRST RUN 2026-10-02 (tmp/us-run1.log, 48 s): PASS, as derived. No gate moved and none was rerun.
//  - I1: the dip's lines have its divergence on every dock, and stepBeat and sourcedBeat agree bit for bit on all 1,024
//    beats. I2: total divergence 0 for both line fields; placeLines refuses the uniform 1. I3: curl 0 in every H1 run.
//  - H1: on both bases and for c = 1, -2, 50, 0 link-beats with a step off, 0 dock-beats with a rest off, 0 dock-beats
//    with the rate off its uniform shift, 0 docks of found depth off. The rates wrapped 8,192, 20,480 and 471,040 times
//    (c = 1, -2, 50) and the steps never noticed. P1 does not fire.
//  - C1: the uniform 1 ends with 0 links tilted and spread 0; 1 + dip, 1 + planes and the slab tilt 35,360, 20,480 and
//    17,920 links, depth spreads 0.389, 0.596 and 1.864; the planar contrast averaged over the run is 0.6740 against the
//    static 2/3 (1.1 percent). The slab's departure demands steps past the window: it slips (3,916,800 step wraps,
//    curl on 6,320,128 link-beats), so its depth is not single valued; its gates (a tilt) are met but it is not a clean
//    static field.
//  - Read: the sub-unit uniform source (1 / 297^3 of a content unit a dock) changes no step on the zero base, and on the
//    dip base changes steps on 34,457,618 link-beats by at most 228 register units (8.6e-6 of a whole step): below one
//    content unit the blindness is only up to the carried rest's rounding, and content comes in whole units.
//
// Depth L1: exact integer arithmetic and a derivation it checks. DETERMINISM: every source is placed; nothing is drawn.
