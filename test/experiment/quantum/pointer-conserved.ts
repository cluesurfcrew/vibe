// THE POINTER IS WHAT THE ENVIRONMENT CONSERVES (E-QTM-0166, OPEN-QTM-06, the route "the pointer is what the environment
// conserves" in routes/quantum-relativity-light-computation.md, row "A · decoherence and pointer states"). Einselection
// picks the eigenbasis of what the system-environment coupling keeps. E-FND-0170 found that the only local conserved
// densities of the working rule are the love and fear counts (written pleasure and pain below; the code keeps the old
// names). The route reads from this that the one pointer a covariant
// rule can pick is a dock's pleasure and pain numbers, a charge-like superselection, and not the role, which would also
// explain E-QTM-0154 (a frame-covariant rule with a frame-invariant environment depolarizes every role basis alike).
// This file runs the route's test on C* (E-FND-0160): a member in a superposition of two local pleasure counts against a
// member in a superposition of two roles at one dock, both coupled by the rule to the same environment, and reads the
// off-diagonal of the system's reduced state every beat.
//
// WHAT IS RUN, AND WHY IT IS NOT THE TEST AS WRITTEN.
//  - THE VACUUM OF C* IS NOT AN ENVIRONMENT. C*'s vacuum is the full sea (both tones' seas filled). Every piece of the
//    rule is one-body on a lone hole, and the one-body pieces are blind to the role and to the tone (E-FND-0160: R*'s
//    pieces act as R* (x) 1 on role and tone; both species run the same orbit). So a member alone in 8 to 16 vacuum docks
//    keeps every role coherence and every tone coherence exactly, at any number of docks: both superpositions dephase at
//    one rate, zero. That is the route's kill condition met for a structural reason, and it reads nothing about which
//    basis an environment picks, because the full sea couples to nothing. The rule couples a member only to another hole
//    (the sector pair pieces and the fear beat act on hole pairs counted from the sea). So the closest decisive version
//    takes as the environment one other hole, a pain-tone member, together with both members' positions over the docks
//    of the box: the L = 2 D4 torus (8 docks, the route's range) and the L = 4 torus (128 docks).
//  - "A LOCAL PLEASURE COUNT" ON C*. The tone is a species: a hole of the pain sea is a pleasure-tone member (pleasure count 1 at its
//    dock), a hole of the pleasure sea a pain-tone member (pain count 1). A superposition of two local pleasure counts at one dock
//    is taken as the member superposed between pleasure-tone and pain-tone, same dock, same orbital start, same role chi1:
//    one branch has (pleasure, pain) counts (1, 0) at the member's place, the other (0, 1). The rule keeps each species'
//    number, so the tone is conserved by the whole dynamics: the two branches never mix, and the system's reduced
//    off-diagonal is the overlap of what the rest of the world does in each branch. The rule cannot prepare such a state
//    (it never changes a count); it is put in by hand, as environment-induced superselection arguments do.
//  - THE ROLE SUPERPOSITION. A pleasure-tone member in (|a> + |b>) / sqrt 2, a and b two states of one of the 4 role bases
//    (the 4 line classes of the role grid, the qutrit's 4 stabilizer bases), same orbital start.
//  - THE ENVIRONMENT MEMBER is pain-tone with role chi2 one of the 12 line states. So in the role case and in the pleasure
//    branch the pair is unlike (distinguishable, kernel V = 1 + (w - 1) Phi Phi^dag), and in the pain branch the pair is
//    like (identical fermions, kernel U = P_sym + w P_anti), w the knit's fear angle ringUnit(0, 2), as in E-FND-0160.
//  - THE FAMILIES. Tone: chi1 over the 12 line states, chi2 over the 12 (144 cases). Role: 4 classes x 3 pairs (a, b) x
//    12 chi2 (144 cases). Both families are closed under the 216 grid moves, so neither favours a frame.
//  - THE ORBITS. E-FND-0160's rule (the member mixers at ringUnit(-1, 4), the sector string ringUnit(-2, 1) a unit of V
//    capped at 8, the sector contact v^2 with v = ringUnit(2, 0), hole angles reversed), run on E-SPN-0175's two-hole
//    engine (code/measure/register-sea: the full slot-and-register space of both holes at every relative dock, no
//    truncation, floats on exact pieces), one beat at a time. Two starts: S1, both members at one dock in the moving
//    states of slot 0 and slot 1, register 0 (E-FND-0160's start, modes 0 and 8); S2, modes 17 (slot 2, register 1) and
//    109 (slot 13, register 5), not in the probes (the smoke saw it for 4 beats). 96 beats.
//
// DERIVED BEFORE THE GATE RUN (L1, from the construction).
// 1. THE KERNELS ARE CHANNELS. Both kernels and the control kernel below are sum_k e^(i theta_k) Pi_k with projectors Pi_k
//    on the role pair that commute with the role swap, and every other piece is role-blind and tone-blind. So each
//    branch is a sum over channels of one orbital run W_k psi0 (the contact phase moved by theta_k) times Pi_k chi, chi =
//    chi1 (x) chi2. Everything below is fixed by the channel overlaps G_kl = <W_k psi0 | W_l psi0> and the exchange
//    overlaps H_kl = <X W_k psi0 | W_l psi0>, X the exchange of the two holes (y -> -y, modes swapped).
// 2. THE TONE COHERENCE. Pleasure branch: Psi_L = sum_l W_l psi0 (x) Pi^L_l chi (Pi^L: Phi-perp with theta 0, Phi with w).
//    Pain branch, antisymmetrized: Psi_F = sum_k [W_k P_- psi0 (x) Pi^F_k chi_s + W_k P_+ psi0 (x) Pi^F_k chi_a], P_+- =
//    (1 +- X) / 2, chi_s and chi_a the swap-symmetric and antisymmetric parts (Pi^F: sym with 0, anti with w). The
//    off-diagonal of the dock's (pleasure, pain) count in the reduced state is <Psi_F | Psi_L> up to the fixed factor of the
//    second-quantized flip b_F^dag a_L, and
//      <Psi_F | Psi_L> = sum_kl [ (G_kl - H_kl) / 2 <Pi^F_k chi_s | Pi^L_l chi> + (G_kl + H_kl) / 2 <Pi^F_k chi_a | Pi^L_l chi> ].
//    The decoherence factor is D_T(t) = |<Psi_F | Psi_L>(t)| / |<Psi_F | Psi_L>(0)|. The tone populations are kept
//    exactly, since each species' number is conserved.
// 3. THE ROLE COHERENCE. rho_pair = sum_kl G_lk (Pi^L_k chi)(Pi^L_l chi)^dag, rho_1 = Tr_2 rho_pair, and D_R(t) =
//    |<a| rho_1(t) |b>| / |<a| rho_1(0) |b>|. The role populations are not kept: the singlet kernel moves weight
//    between a member's roles.
// 4. THE FEAR BEAT OFF KEEPS BOTH. With one channel every G and H is fixed in time, so D_T = D_R = 1: on C* every bit of
//    either dephasing comes from the fear beat.
// 5. A TONE-BLIND, ROLE-READING ENVIRONMENT KEEPS THE TONE (the control's design). If the like and unlike branches take
//    the same channels Pi_k, the overlap in point 2 is sum_k [<P_- psi0|psi0><Pi_k chi_s|Pi_k chi> + <P_+ psi0|psi0>
//    <Pi_k chi_a|Pi_k chi>] (W_k unitary and commuting with X), constant: D_T = 1 exactly, while a kernel diagonal in
//    the role's Z basis records role 0 against role 1 in the orbit. The control kernel is w^(n0), n0 the number of the
//    pair's members in role |0>, taken by both branches: channels n0 = 0, 1, 2 with contact angles 0, w, w^2.
// 6. WHAT IS NOT DERIVABLE is the size of each dephasing once the members are walkers: which of the two the rule's own
//    kernels make larger. A heuristic, not a derivation: in the tone case the two branches differ in which kernel acts
//    at all (the 3-dimensional anti channel takes w in one branch, the 1-dimensional singlet in the other), while the
//    role case is read only through the singlet.
//
// PROBES BEFORE THE GATES, disclosed (they set the thresholds; no gate moved after the gate run).
//  tmp/pc-probe1-L2.log (L = 2, 8 docks, start S1, 64 beats, the same families): mean coherence over the cases at beat
//   1: tone 0.7517, role 0.9185; mean loss a beat over the 64 beats: tone 0.2889, role 0.1094 (ratio 2.64). The box
//   recurs: g = <W_0 psi0 | W_1 psi0> returns to 1 at beats 24 and 48, so there is no exponential rate, only a
//   time-averaged loss. Role populations moved by up to 0.167. The control kernel: tone kept to 1e-13, role mean loss
//   0.246. Some cases do not dephase at all in either family (chi2 that makes both kernels act trivially).
//  tmp/pc-probe1-L4.log (L = 4, 128 docks, S1, 64 beats): beat 1 tone 0.7538, role 0.9188; mean loss a beat tone
//   0.1854, role 0.0587 (ratio 3.16); role populations moved by up to 0.085; control tone 9e-12 off 1, role 0.1345;
//   norms within 1.1e-12. The gates sit at a ratio of 1.5, about half the probes' 2.6 to 3.2, and the gate run adds the
//   unprobed start S2 and 32 more beats.
//  tmp/pc-smoke.log (this file with 4 beats, every code path): L = 2 and 4, S1 as in the probes; S2, seen here for 4
//   beats only, mean coherence at beat 1 tone 0.835, role 0.918 (ratio of losses 2.0, its exchange overlap h is about
//   0, so its pain branch has no exchange term). The smoke read the instrument's float floor at L = 4: the fear-off
//   residual 1.3e-11 and the role reduction against reducedRole 5e-12 after 4 beats, above the 1e-12 first written for
//   I1 (c) and (d), because both carry the runs' norm drift. Those two tolerances were set to 1e-9 before the gate run;
//   no physics gate was touched.
//
// HYPOTHESES AND GATES, fixed before the gate run. Boxes L = 2 and L = 4, starts S1 and S2, 96 beats, the 144 + 144
//  cases. loss_T = the mean over beats 1..96 and over the 144 tone cases of 1 - D_T, loss_R the same for the role
//  cases; first_T, first_R the same at beat 1 alone.
//  I1 INSTRUMENT. (a) The exchange route: <W_k P_-+ psi0 | W_l psi0> read from separately run P_-+ psi0 equals (G_kl -+
//     H_kl) / 2 within 1e-10 for k, l in {0, 1} at every beat (this checks that the rule commutes with the exchange and
//     the algebra of point 2). (b) Every run keeps its norm within 1e-10. (c) The fear beat off (every channel replaced
//     by channel 0): D_T and D_R within 1e-9 of 1 for every case at every beat. (d) The role reduction of point 3 for
//     the model kernel equals the partial trace of E-FND-0160's reducedRole(chi, g) within 1e-9 for every role case at
//     every beat (reducedRole takes the channel norms as exactly 1, so the two differ by the norm drift).
//  C1 CONTROL, THE OTHER OUTCOME IS READABLE. Under the tone-blind role-diagonal kernel of point 5, on every box and
//     start: loss_R >= 0.05 and every D_T within 1e-9 of 1 at every beat. There the role dephases and the tone does not,
//     which is the route's kill outcome, so the reader can see it.
//  H1 THE ROUTE'S HYPOTHESIS. On every box and start, loss_T >= 1.5 loss_R and first_T >= 1.5 first_R: the dock's pleasure
//     and pain count dephases faster than any role superposition, on average over frames.
//  P1 THE FALSIFIER (the route's kill). On some box and start loss_T <= 1.1 loss_R: one rate (within 10%) or the role
//     faster.
// VERDICT. Fail if P1 fires. Pass if H1, I1 and C1 hold. Partial if P1 does not fire but H1 fails (a ratio between 1.1
//  and 1.5), or if I1 or C1 fails.
// READ, gating nothing: the mean coherences at beats 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, 96; the per-class role loss (frame covariance
//  makes the four equal when chi2 runs over all 12 states); the largest role population drift; the least and largest
//  D_T and D_R; |g| and |h| at the reads.
//
// WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT SHOW. It can show, at L2, that on C* the environment the rule supplies (one other hole and the
// docks) records a member's tone more strongly than its role, in every frame on average, and that the tone is the only
// one of the two whose populations the coupling keeps. It cannot show einselection in the usual sense: the environment
// is one hole, not a bath, the box recurs, so there is no rate and no irreversibility, and the coherence lost returns.
// The charge superposition cannot be prepared by the rule, so the result is about a state put in by hand, which is the
// standard status of superselection arguments (Wick, Wightman, Wigner 1952; Zurek 2003). The vacuum (the full sea) is
// shown, by derivation, to be no environment at all on C*, which is what the route asked for literally. C* is not the
// adopted rule, two holes on the 4d D4 torus are not the husk, and no ledger row becomes held from it.
//
// FIRST RUN 2026-10-02 (tmp/pc-qtm-run1.log, 530 s): PASS, as predicted. No gate moved and none was rerun.
//  - H1: mean coherence loss a beat over 96 beats, tone against role: L = 2 (8 docks) S1 0.2828 against 0.1073 (ratio
//    2.64), S2 0.1097 against 0.0543 (2.02); L = 4 (128 docks) S1 0.1882 against 0.0595 (3.16), S2 0.1222 against
//    0.0602 (2.03). At beat 1: 0.2483 against 0.0815 (3.05) and 0.1646 against 0.0815 (2.02) on L = 2, 0.2462 against
//    0.0812 (3.03) and 0.1647 against 0.0816 (2.02) on L = 4. P1 did not fire: the least ratio is 2.02.
//  - C1: the tone-blind role-diagonal kernel dephases the role (loss a beat 0.121 to 0.241) and keeps the tone to
//    1.3e-11, so the reader sees the other outcome where the coupling makes it.
//  - I1: the exchange route agrees with separately run P_-+ psi0 to 4.3e-12, norms kept to 1.3e-12, the fear beat off
//    keeps both coherences to 1.3e-11, the role reduction matches reducedRole to 6.8e-12.
//  - Reads. The role loss is the same in all 4 classes to 1e-16 (frame covariance, as E-QTM-0154 has it). The role
//    populations move by up to 0.167 (L = 2) and 0.097 (L = 4); the tone populations cannot move. The least single-case
//    coherence over the run is 0.361 (tone) against 0.667 (role) on L = 2 S1 and 0.568 against 0.807 on L = 4 S1; in both
//    families some cases never dephase (environment roles on which both kernels act trivially). The L = 2 box recurs
//    exactly every 24 beats (|g| back to 1, every coherence back to 1), so what is read is a time-averaged loss, not a
//    rate. S2, whose exchange overlap is about 0, gives the smaller ratio, about 2: part of S1's larger tone loss comes
//    from the fermion exchange term of the pain branch.
