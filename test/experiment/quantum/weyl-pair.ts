// MATTER'S WEYL PAIR ON A RING, AND THE CONTINUUM LIMIT OF THE COLUMN'S PAIR (E-QTM-0167, OPEN-QTM-02, which blocks
// OPEN-QTM-03). Routes file quantum-relativity-light-computation.md, section "A · canonical commutation", rows
// "matter's Weyl pair first" (line 102) and "the continuum limit" (line 105). The ledger holds canonical commutation
// partial: the Weyl pair holds on a column (E-FRC-0230) and not yet on the whole husk.
//
// Row 102 reads: the lone vibe on its line is the fear walk bit for bit (E-QTM-0157). On a ring of L docks its position
// phase U and the ring's translation by one dock V are a clock and shift pair, U V = e^(2 pi i/L) V U, and the beat must
// commute with the translation; that is [x, p] in Weyl form for matter. Test: the Weyl relation and the beat's
// commutation with translation on rings L = 3, 6, 9, 27, exact, on 17 starts. Kill: the beat fails to commute with
// translation on starts whose ring holonomy is not trivial, as E-QTM-0157's after-wrap L1 0.30 suggests; then read it
// with the holonomy as a twisted boundary.
// Row 105 reads: Schwinger's Weyl pairs give [x, p] = i as N grows, with sqrt N spacing. Read the column as N = 2D + 1
// and the scaled commutator on low-lying states, D = 4 to 64, lowest 5 levels. Kill: the low levels' commutator does
// not approach i with an error falling as a power of N.
//
// WHAT IS RUN.
// (a) The lone vibe's one-beat map B on its line, read off the working rule itself (code/rule/coined-locked-knit
//     coinedVetoBeat, veto 'none', tables on the pass contact, the empty box, as E-QTM-0157), on the 18 L states of the
//     line: dock j = 0 .. L - 1 along slot 0 from the box's center, direction (slot 0 or its opposite), and the
//     vibe's point p = 0 .. 8 (the 9 role points the links move, E-QTM-0117). The box is the D4 weave of side L, whose
//     slot-0 line is a ring of exactly L docks (probe 1). For L = 3, 6, 9 every column of B is read off the rule at
//     beats 0 and 1. For L = 27 (531,441 docks, 1.7 s a beat) and the side-16 box B is assembled from the rule's own
//     stream tables (target, move) and the coin's two coefficients, and checked against the rule's beat on 9 (L = 27)
//     or 18 (side 16) columns per start. Amplitudes are Eisenstein integers over 2, exact.
// (b) Two translations by one dock: the plain shift T0 (j, d, p) -> (j + 1, d, p), and the transported shift
//     T (j, d, p) -> (j + 1, d, m_j p) with m_j the grid move of the slot-0 link leaving dock j (the parallel
//     transport the rule itself applies to a vibe crossing that link). The clock U = diag(zeta_L^j). The holonomy H is
//     the product of the slot-0 links round the ring, read at dock 0, a permutation of the 9 points.
// (c) The column of E-FRC-0230 as Schwinger's pair: N = 2D + 1, x = s m (m = -D .. D), p = F^-1 diag(s b) F, s =
//     sqrt(2 pi / N), and the finite oscillator H = (x^2 + p^2)/2, which commutes with the quarter turn F, so its
//     levels are the column's rungs. Read c_n = -i <n|[x, p]|n> for n = 0 .. 4 and D = 4 .. 64 (floats, Householder
//     tridiagonal + QL, code/measure/quantum-ladder symmetricEigen).
//
// DERIVED BEFORE THE GATE RUN.
// - The coin copies the vibe's point unchanged and is the same on every dock; the stream moves a slot-0 vibe from dock
//   j to j + 1 applying m_j, and a back-slot vibe from dock j to j - 1 applying the back link l_j. If every back link
//   undoes the forward link it pairs with, l_(j+1) m_j = 1 (probe 1: true on every start and side tried), then on
//   right movers B T and T B both give (j + 2, m_(j+1) m_j p), and on left movers both give (j, p). So [B, T] = 0 on
//   every start whatever the holonomy, and [B, T0] = 0 only if the links along the line are all one move. The route's
//   kill, read on T, cannot fire if the links pair up; read on T0, it fires on every start with non-uniform links,
//   holonomy or not (control C1b separates the two).
// - U T = zeta_L T U holds for any shift by one dock (it is j + 1 - j = 1 mod L, including the wrap). It is kinematic.
// - T^L = H at each dock, so the strict pair of Z_L (V^L = 1, Stone-von Neumann's irreducible clock and shift) holds only
//   where H = 1. Where H has a cycle of length c, T's orbit through those c points has length L c: on that orbit T is
//   the plain shift of a ring of L c docks, the covering ring. So the pair is the Z_(L c) Weyl pair of the covering
//   ring, with clock zeta_(L c) (the twisted boundary of the route's kill text, a flux 2 pi k / c).
// - Hence the lone vibe started on point 0 is the fear walk on the covering ring of L c_0 docks, c_0 the length of
//   point 0's cycle under H, bit for bit at every beat, folded onto the L docks. On the side-16 box this predicts
//   E-QTM-0157's after-wrap number: the L1 at beat 16 between the folded covering walk and the ring-16 walk is
//   1,304,279,928 / 4^16 = 0.303676 whenever c_0 >= 2 (the covering walk has not wrapped by beat 16, so every c_0 >= 2
//   gives the same) and 0 when c_0 = 1 (probe 4). E-QTM-0157 logged 0.3037 on 16 starts and 0 on integer+13.
// - Continuum: on low rungs, localized well inside the column, x and p act as the continuum operators up to tails of
//   a Gaussian, so c_n - 1 falls like e^(-a N), faster than any power; tr [x, p] = 0 exactly, so the mean of c_n over
//   all N rungs is 0 and the top rungs are far from 1.
// - Exactness: B is exact in Z[w] over 2. zeta_L lies in Z[w] for L = 3 and 6 only; for 9 and 27 the clock needs
//   Z[zeta_27], which holds Z[w] (zeta_27^9 = w); the Weyl relation is checked as exponents mod L, exactly.
//
// PROBES BEFORE THE GATES, DISCLOSED (tmp/wy-probe1.ts to tmp/wy-probe5.ts, each under 25 s).
// - probe 1 (sides 3, 4, 6, 9, 16, 17 starts): the slot-0 line from the center is a ring of exactly side docks; every
//   back link undoes its forward link (l_(j+1) m_j = 1) on all; the forward links are never all one move; the full
//   holonomy is never the identity. On side 16 the holonomy fixes point 0 only on integer+13, the start where
//   E-QTM-0157 read 0 after the wrap.
// - probe 2: the rule's beat on one vibe, sides 3, 9, 27: two branches, keep (1 + w)/2 on the next dock's same slot and
//   (1 - w)/2 on the previous dock's opposite slot, points moved by the links; the same at beats 0 and 1. Side 27: 6.6 s
//   to build the weave, 1.7 s a beat (so the full rule read of 486 columns on 17 starts is out of the time budget).
// - probe 3: the column oscillator: c_n - 1 at D = 4 is -2e-5, 2e-4, -7e-3, 2e-2, -0.57 for n = 0 .. 4, at D = 8
//   -9e-11 .. -3e-5, at D = 12 below 6e-10, and at the float floor (1e-14) from D = 16 to 64; sum of c_n over all
//   rungs 1e-14 to 6e-13; top rung c = 9.6 (D = 4) to 211 (D = 64).
// - probe 4: the fear walk on rings 16 c folded onto 16 against ring 16 at beat 16: L1 0 for c = 1 and 1,304,279,928 /
//   4^16 for c = 2, 3, 4, 6.
// - probe 5 (tmp/wy-probe5.ts, written after the gates below, to check this file runs): this file with one start
//   (integer+0), rings 3 and 6 and D up to 8. It ran (22 s); on that start I1, C1a to C1d, C2, H1 and H2 read true, and
//   H3 and H4 false only by the cut (integer+13 absent; D = 8 taken as the last D). No gate was changed after it.
//
// HYPOTHESES AND GATES, fixed before the gate run, never moved.
// I1 (instrument) for L = 3, 6, 9 on 17 starts: B read off the rule equals B assembled from the tables, column for
//    column, at beat 0 and at beat 1; for side 16 (18 columns) and L = 27 (9 columns) the rule's beat equals the table
//    B on every sampled column; on every ring and start B stays on the line and is exactly unitary (B^dagger B = 1 in
//    Z[w] over 4).
// C1 (controls, L = 9, every column read off the rule, links replaced on the line only):
//    C1a trivial links: [B, T0] = 0, H = 1, T = T0
//    C1b pure gauge links m_j = g_(j+1) g_j^-1 (g_j spread by the golden Weyl sequence, back links their inverses):
//        [B, T0] != 0, [B, T] = 0, H = 1, every T orbit of length 9
//    C1c one move g of order 4 on every forward link, its inverse on every back link: [B, T0] = 0, H = g^9 = g != 1,
//        T orbits of lengths 9 times g's cycle lengths
//    C1d one back link broken (it undoes its forward link and then shifts the role grid by a translation): [B, T] != 0,
//        so the instrument can read the failure
// C2 (control, continuum): for every D, |sum over all N rungs of c_n| <= 1e-9 and the top rung has |c - 1| > 0.5
// H1 (row 102, commutation and Weyl relation): on 17 of 17 starts at each of L = 3, 6, 9, 27, [B, T] = 0 exactly
//    (0 mismatching columns) and U T = zeta_L T U exactly
// H2 (the twisted boundary): on 17 of 17 starts at each L, T^L is H at every dock, T's orbits on each direction have
//    lengths L times H's cycle lengths, and the lone vibe started at dock 0, slot 0, point 0 equals the fear walk on
//    the covering ring of L c_0 docks bit for bit at every beat 1 .. L c_0 + 1 (B iterated: B is the rule's beat, I1)
// H3 (E-QTM-0157's after-wrap number): on the side-16 box, 17 starts, the table B iterated 16 beats from the center,
//    slot 0, point 0, gives an occupation whose L1 against the ring-16 fear walk equals, exactly, the L1 between the
//    walk on ring 16 c_0 folded and the walk on ring 16; it is 1,304,279,928 / 4^16 (0.3037 to 4 places, as logged)
//    on the starts with c_0 >= 2 and 0 on the starts with c_0 = 1, and those are integer+13 alone
// H4 (row 105): for every D = 8 .. 64 and n = 0 .. 4, |c_n - 1| <= 10 / N^2, and at D = 64 every |c_n - 1| <= 1e-10
// P1 (falsifier, row 102's kill read on the transported translation): some start at some L with H != 1 where
//    [B, T] != 0. P2 (row 105's kill): H4's bound missed at some D >= 8 for some n <= 4.
// Predicted alongside, not a kill: [B, T0] != 0 on 17 of 17 starts at every L (the links are never uniform), and H != 1
// on 17 of 17 at L = 3, 6, 9 (probe 1; L = 27 not probed), so the strict Z_L pair (T^L = 1) holds on none of those.
//
// VERDICT, fixed before the run: fail if I1, C1 or C2 fails (the instrument) or P1 or P2 fires; pass if I1, C1, C2,
// H1, H2, H3, H4 hold; partial otherwise (including H4 or C2 missed only at the float floor).
//
// WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT SHOW. It shows on the rule itself which translation the lone vibe's beat commutes with and
// what the Weyl pair of matter on a ring is once the link holonomy is counted. It does not reach the whole husk: one
// line, one vibe, the empty box (no vacuum, no meeting), love only. The Weyl relation U T = zeta T U is kinematic; the
// content is the commutation and the covering. The continuum part is floats on a known construction (Schwinger 1960);
// it shows the column's low rungs reach [x, p] = i, not that the rule's light does.
//
// FIRST RUN 2026-10-02 (tmp/wy-run1.log, 1,038 s): PASS, every gate as registered, none moved, run once. I1 holds
// (B read off the rule equals the table B on every column at L = 3, 6, 9, beats 0 and 1, and on every sampled column at
// side 16 and L = 27; exactly unitary on every ring and start). C1a to C1d hold: trivial links [B, T0] = 0; pure gauge
// links (holonomy 1) [B, T0] fails on 160 of 162 columns while [B, T] = 0; one order-4 move on every link [B, T0] = 0
// with holonomy that move (cycles 1, 4, 4); a broken back link [B, T] fails on 36 columns. H1: [B, T] = 0 on 17 of 17
// starts at L = 3, 6, 9, 27, U T = zeta_L T U on all; [B, T0] = 0 on 0 of 17 at every L (52 to 484 columns fail), and
// the full holonomy is trivial on 0 of 17 at every L, L = 27 included, so the strict Z_L pair (T^L = 1) holds on no start.
// H2: T^L is the holonomy at every dock, T's orbits are L times its cycle lengths, and the lone vibe is the fear walk on
// the covering ring of L c_0 docks bit for bit to beat L c_0 + 1 on every start and ring (c_0 from 1 to 6; c_0 = 1 where
// the holonomy fixes point 0 although it moves others). H3: side 16 reads 1,304,279,928 / 4^16 = 0.303676 on 16 starts
// (c_0 = 2, 3, 4 or 6) and 0 on integer+13 alone, E-QTM-0157's after-wrap numbers. H4 and C2: |c_n - 1| for n = 0 .. 4
// is 2.1e-5 to 0.57 at D = 4, 8.9e-11 to 2.9e-5 at D = 8, 5.4e-10 at most at D = 12, and at the float floor (2.6e-14 at
// most) from D = 16 to 64; falling like e^(-1.55 N) for n = 0 between D = 4 and 8, faster than any power. The sum of c_n
// over all rungs is 3.1e-12 at most, and the top rung reads 9.6 (D = 4) to 211 (D = 64). So the route's kill as written
// fires for the plain shift on every start, but control C1b shows the cause is the links' non-uniformity, not the
// holonomy; the transported shift commutes on every start, and the holonomy enters as a twisted boundary: matter's pair
// on a ring of L docks is the Z_(L c) pair of the covering ring.
//
// DETERMINISM: no random number; starts are E-MTH-0028's family; the gauge of C1b is the golden Weyl sequence
// (code/tool/weyl). Depth L2: the matter half is exact algebra in Z[w] over 2; the continuum half is floats.
