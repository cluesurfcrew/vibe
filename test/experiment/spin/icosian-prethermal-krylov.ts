// STATE 2026-10-02: GATE RUN DONE (4 threads, 20,255 s), PARTIAL: every hypothesis held and C2 missed its threshold by
// 1.9e-11 (GATE RUN below). No gate moved. The droplet run of 2026-10-01 left no result in the package.
// DOES THE SMALL-ANGLE 2I BEAT KEEP THE ORDERED VACUUM ON A PATCH WITH A NEAR-CONTINUOUS SPECTRUM (E-SPN-0185, OPEN-STR-02)?
// E-SPN-0154 found, on the husk tetrahedron (3 loops, 29,288 Gauss states, a 1,589-state symmetric sector), that the
// prepared ground state of H = H_E + 8 H_B is lost within a beat for 1/delta up to 12, survives tau = 3, 10, 40, 40 beats
// at 1/delta 16, 24, 32, 49 (ln tau = 0.346 + 0.0778/delta) and is kept from 1/delta 64 on. Its "Next" named the gap: on
// a 1,589-level sector a decay can be CUT by the discrete spectrum, so the step from 40 beats to "kept" between 48.6 and
// 64.2 may be finite size, and "a Krylov evolution of the whole Gauss sector of a 4-loop patch at 1/delta 16 to 64 is the
// next measurement". This file is that measurement. The machinery is code/measure/gauss-orbit (the register stored on
// its Gauss orbits, threaded, matrix free) and code/measure/prethermal-krylov (the beat and the survival amplitude).
//
// DERIVED BEFORE THE RUN.
// 1. THE PATCH. The tetrahedron with an EAR (prethermal-patch huskTetrahedronEar): docks 0, (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1) and
//    a fifth, (1,0,-1), one face diagonal from docks 0 and (1,1,0) only, closing a fifth husk triangle on link 01. 5 docks,
//    8 links, 5 triangles, loops 4. It CONTAINS the tetrahedron, so the size trend triangle (1 loop) < rhombus (2) <
//    tetrahedron (3) < this (4) is a chain of patches each inside the next. Gauge fixed on the breadth-first tree from dock
//    0 (links 01, 02, 03, 04), a configuration is 4 digits: 120^4 = 207,360,000 configurations, and the Gauss sector (the
//    global conjugation orbits, -1 central so A5 acts) is (1/120) sum_g |C(g)|^4 = 3,460,496 orbits (E-SPN-0154's
//    "about 1.7e6" was 120^4/120, which forgets that -1 acts trivially). Each patch automorphism (4 of them) keeps H, so
//    the symmetric sector is about 8.7e5 states: some 550 times the tetrahedron's 1,589, and its levels lie about 1e-3
//    apart in energy against a beat-frequency window that a run of 1,024 beats resolves only to 2 pi/1024 = 6e-3. Over
//    the run the spectrum is continuous to the beat.
// 2. THE HAMILTONIAN AND THE BEAT are E-SPN-0154's exactly: integer electric exponents n_R = d_R^2 - 1, the integer
//    magnetic class function n_B, r = 8 (E-SPN-0154's coupling, fixed here before any run so the two patches are
//    compared at one coupling; the plaquette on this patch is read, not chosen), F = E(theta) M(2 r theta) E(theta) with
//    w = e^(i theta) the least ring unit of Z[w][1/7] within 2% of each target delta (smallAngleUnits), E applied link by
//    link with each link's kernel u(h) = sum_R e^(i theta n_R) (d_R/120) chi_R(h) (linkUnitary).
// 3. THE MEASUREMENT, MATRIX FREE. psi0 = the lowest state of H on the Gauss sector, by restarted Lanczos from the
//    constant state (the r = 0 ground state, symmetric under every automorphism). The survival amplitude A(N) = <psi0|F^N
//    psi0> by doubling: F is complex symmetric in the orbit basis (u(h) = u(h^-1), M diagonal) and psi0 real, so A(2k) =
//    a_k^T E(2 theta) a_k and A(2k + 1) = b_k^T M b_k with a_(k+1) = M b_k: 512 passes of E(2 theta) give A(N) to N = 1,025.
//    tau is E-SPN-0154's: the first beat of the grid (1, then 10 a decade) where the running-mean fidelity over beats 1..N
//    falls to 1/2. A run stops at N = 1,025, or once tau is found and N >= 4 tau (and >= 16), reading the running mean
//    there.
// 4. THE PREDICTION (ADHH, counted as in E-SPN-0154). ln tau = a + c/delta with c in [2 pi/J_hi, 8 pi/J_lo]: J_lo =
//    max(max n_R, r max n_B) = max(35, 160) = 160 and J_hi = 35 + 3 x 160 = 515 (link 01 now sits on 3 triangles), so c in
//    [0.0122, 0.157]. ADHH's slope is a property of the LOCAL terms, so it should not move with the patch: the 4-loop slope
//    should match the tetrahedron's. What should move is the cut: the tetrahedron jumps from 40 beats to kept between 48.6
//    and 64.2, and on a continuous spectrum the line through its finite points predicts tau(64.2) = e^(0.346 + 0.0778 x
//    64.16) = 209 and tau(96) = 2,400, the first inside a 1,025-beat run and the second past it.
//
// HYPOTHESES, written before any survival run on the 4-loop patch (the gates, fixed). Ladder 1/delta in {12, 16, 24, 32,
// 48, 64, 96}, r = 8, runs to N = 1,025.
//  H1 THE RATE ON A CONTINUOUS SPECTRUM: among ladder points with 1 < tau <= 1,025 there are at least 4, spanning a factor
//     at least 2 in 1/delta; the least-squares line ln tau = a + c/delta through them misses no point by more than ln 3;
//     and c lies in [2 pi/J_hi, 8 pi/J_lo] = [0.0122, 0.157].
//  H2 THE SLOPE IS LOCAL: the 4-loop c lies within a factor 2 of the tetrahedron's c read by the same engine, grid and run
//     length (E-SPN-0154's 0.0778 if its four finite points reproduce).
//  H3 A WINDOW IS KEPT AT THIS SIZE: at the ladder's top, 1/delta 96, the running-mean fidelity stays above 1/2 through N =
//     1,025 (tau > 1,025).
//  H4 (a registered prediction that gates nothing) THE TETRAHEDRON'S STEP WAS FINITE SIZE: tau(64.2) is finite on the
//     4-loop patch, within a factor 3 of 209 (70 to 630).
//  P  FALSIFIER: H1 or H3 fails. The exp(c/delta) law does not hold on a continuous spectrum, or no window is kept.
//
// CONTROLS (a failure makes the verdict partial; each could fail).
//  C1 THE STRONG BEAT HEATS: at 1/delta = 1 the running-mean fidelity at N = 65 is at most 0.01 and tau <= 4.
//  C2 THE COMMUTING BEAT KEEPS: at r = 0 the beat is E(2 theta) and its ground state the constant state; at 1/delta 1 and
//     16, f >= 1 - 1e-10 at every N <= 33. A kernel whose trivial-irrep weight is not 1 fails here.
//  C3 THE TRIVIAL GROUP is the number 1: one orbit, the link kernel u = 1 exactly, A(N) = 1 exactly to N = 33.
// INSTRUMENT (a failure makes the verdict partial).
//  I1 THE ENGINE REPRODUCES E-SPN-0154: on the tetrahedron, the orbit engine's ground energy equals the dense sector's to
//     1e-8 and its doubled fidelities equal the dense Floquet closed form at every N <= 257 to 1e-9, at 1/delta 16.3,
//     32.3, 64.2.
//  I2 DOUBLING AGAINST THE PLAIN BEAT on the 4-loop patch: A(N) for N <= 6 at 1/delta 16.3 by E, M, E beat after beat
//     equals the doubled A(N) to 1e-10.
//  I3 UNITARITY: | sum_o |o| |a_k|^2 - 1 | <= 1e-10 at every pass of every ladder point.
//  I4 EXACT TABLES: orbits equal Burnside on every patch; n_B is constant on every orbit (all 1,728,000 configurations
//     of the tetrahedron, every 997th of the 4-loop patch's).
//  I5 THE PREPARED STATE: Lanczos residual ||H psi0 - E0 psi0|| <= 1e-6, and the lowest value from a start that breaks
//     every symmetry (the Weyl stream) equals E0 to 1e-8, so psi0 is the Gauss sector's ground state.
//  I6 THREADS: one pass of E(theta) on the tetrahedron with 1 thread and with the run's threads agree bit for bit.
// READ (gating nothing): the plaquette and perimeter-4 loop of psi0; the triangle and rhombus ladders by the same engine
// (the first kept point by size); the running-mean fidelity at the stop; the second Ritz value (an estimate of the gap).
// VERDICT, fixed before the run: PARTIAL if a control or the instrument fails; else FAIL if H1 or H3 fails; else PASS if H2
// holds, PARTIAL if it does not.
//
// PROBES BEFORE THE GATE RUN, disclosed. tmp/st-probe1.log and st-probe2.log: the 4-loop table (3,460,496 orbits, 5 s)
// and the cost of one link pass (33 s for all 8 links on one thread, no dynamics). tmp/st-probe3.log: the engine on the
// tetrahedron against E-SPN-0154's dense sector at 1/delta 16.3 (ground energy 103.17117425755 against 103.17117425755,
// fidelities to 1.8e-12 over 257 beats, the plain beat against doubling to 4e-14). No survival on the 4-loop patch was
// computed before the gates above were written. One smoke AFTER the gates (tmp/st-smoke-a.log, 264 s): the whole run
// with the TETRAHEDRON in place of the 4-loop patch, ladder 12, 16, 64, 96 and runs to N = 65, to exercise every path:
// every control and instrument held (I1 to 1e-11, I6 bit for bit); no 4-loop survival was computed. No gate moved.
//
// GATE RUN (2026-10-02, 4 threads, 20,255 s): PARTIAL, by the rule fixed above, because C2 missed. No gate moved and none
// was rerun.
//  - The 4-loop patch, r = 8: tau 1, 1, 8, 25, 32, 398, inf at 1/delta 11.85, 16.29, 23.55, 32.29, 48.60, 64.16, 96.24.
//    The tetrahedron by the same engine: 1, 3, 10, 40, 40, inf, inf (E-SPN-0154's four finite points reproduce).
//  - H1 holds: 4 finite points (1/delta 23.55 to 64.16, span 2.72), the fit c 0.08636, a 0.048, worst miss 0.779 under
//    ln 3, and c inside [0.0122, 0.1571].
//  - H2 holds: c 0.08636 against the tetrahedron's 0.07782 by the same engine, a factor 1.11.
//  - H3 holds: at 1/delta 96.24 tau > 1,025, the running-mean fidelity 0.9974 at N 1,025.
//  - H4 holds: tau(64.16) = 398, inside [70, 630]. The tetrahedron is kept there; the 4-loop patch is not, so the step
//    from 40 beats to kept on the tetrahedron was finite size, as predicted.
//  - Controls: C1 holds (1/delta 1.016: running mean 3.5e-6 at N 65, tau 1). C3 holds (one orbit, kernel 1 + 0 i, A(N) =
//    1 to N 33). C2 FAILS: the least fidelity of the commuting beat from the constant state is 0.99999999988081 at both
//    1/delta 1 and 16, below the gate 1 - 1e-10 by 1.9e-11.
//  - Instrument: I1 (tetrahedron E0 to the dense sector's digits, fidelities to 9.9e-12 to N 257), I2 (1.2e-13), I3
//    (unitarity at most 2.7e-11), I4 (orbits = Burnside, 0 n_B mismatches of 207,984 sampled), I5 (E0 130.4163819231,
//    residual 1.28e-8, the Weyl start the same to 1.7e-10), I6 (1 and 4 threads bit for bit) all hold.
//  - READ: the 4-loop plaquette 0.8581 and perimeter-4 loop 0.8295 of psi0. Triangle (9 orbits) kept at every point;
//    rhombus (296 orbits) tau 1 and 79 at 1/delta 11.9 and 16.3, kept from 23.5 on.
//  - READ AFTER THE GATE (not a gate, and the verdict stands): C2's deficit is the same, 1.19e-10, at two beat angles 16
//    times apart, and the same control held on the tetrahedron (29,288 orbits) in the smoke. A deficit that does not
//    move with the angle reads as the start's normalization at 3,460,496 orbits (rounding in sums of that length is of
//    that order), not as a kernel whose trivial-irrep weight is off. Not tested here; a compensated normalization of
//    the constant state would test it.
//  - ALSO SEEN: the restarted Lanczos for psi0 reached an estimate of 1.28e-8 in 2 cycles and then ran cycles 3 to 12 at
//    1 step each with no progress: its invariant-subspace stop (1e-10 (|a| + 1), 1.3e-8 here) sits above LANCZOS_TOL
//    1e-9, so it cannot reach the tolerance once the residual lies between them. It cost about 2.5 minutes, and I5's
//    1e-6 gate held.
//
// Depth L2 (Floquet prethermalization of a finite-group lattice gauge theory on a husk patch; the beat's angle is a ring
// unit of the vibe ring, the register is a hand-built lattice gauge theory, not the rule). DETERMINISM: no random
// numbers; the Lanczos starts are the constant state and the Weyl stream; results are the same bit for bit at any thread
// count. NOTHING MOVES: a link holds a value, a plaquette reads the product around it.
