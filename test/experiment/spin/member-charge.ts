// THE CHARGE OF A MEMBER, OF A WALL LEVEL AND OF THE JOIN CHANNEL (E-SPN-0189, OPEN-MAT-01, which blocks OPEN-MAT-02).
// Three routes of note/research/vibe/roadmap/routes/matter-forces-numbers.md ask the same reading, each in minutes:
//  - line 160, "the wall member is the electron": read E-SPN-0168's wall member's (love - fear)/3 charge and its turn
//    sign; killed if "charge 0 or fractional on every light wall level".
//  - line 163, "the register member alone": E-SPN-0160's member's charge and spin per half on the register rule; killed
//    if "charge not one in either half".
//  - line 573, "E-FRC-0273's channel as Fermi's contact": the charge of the S -> D channel's in and out pairs; killed if
//    "no channel changes charge, so it is a neutral current".
// Dropped, and why: line 161 (the census of gauge invariant states up to two members on the slab) is hours, not minutes,
// and is a composition; line 574 (a rishon rearrangement) and line 523 (a W-shaped two-body transition) need a new
// piece; lines 522 and 665 (the trace and the hypercharge table) belong to other open items. What this file finds for
// line 161 is read, not gated (READ below).
//
// WHAT IS RUN. The charge (love - fear)/3 is the vibe count in thirds (E-FRC-0243, code/measure/charge-count: love +1,
// fear -1, calm 0, Q = (love - fear)/3). On the register rule the tone is a species label, not a register component
// (E-FND-0160): the love field and the fear field each fill their own full sea, a hole of the love sea is a fear-tone
// member (one vibe, -1), a hole of the fear sea a love-tone member (+1), and every register piece acts as (x) 1 on the
// tone. So the one-body charge is q = 1 (x) diag(+1/3, -1/3) on (slot, register) (x) tone, and a member's charge
// relative to the sea is minus the charge of the mode it empties. This file lifts the rule's own one-body cycles to the
// two tones, diagonalizes the lifted cycle with the generic unitary solver (which mixes the tones inside each degenerate
// level arbitrarily), and reads the spectrum of q compressed to every light level: the charges a level can carry. It
// does the same for the join channel's in and out pairs, reads the exact Fock count, and reads every conserved one-body
// charge the register itself could carry (the commutant), against Furey's number operator (the route's prior art).
//
// DERIVED BEFORE THE GATE RUN.
// 1. A MEMBER IS ONE VIBE (L1). One hole of the full sea is the member (E-SPN-0163, Jacobi), and a hole removes one
//    mode, one vibe of one tone: Q = -1/3 for a love-sea hole, +1/3 for a fear-sea hole. The full seas carry 3Q = 8 - 8
//    = 0 per slot. Charge one needs |N_love - N_fear| = 3: at least three members of one tone. One member, or two, cannot
//    carry it (two give at most 2/3).
// 2. THE CHARGE IS REGISTER-BLIND (L1). q acts as 1 on the register, so it commutes with J and with every piece (24 Q_S,
//    48 Q_D, the chiral and Wilson pieces, the stream, the SU(2)+ field, the join): each half + and half - member carries
//    the same charge, and every eigenspace of a lifted cycle splits into a love-tone and a fear-tone copy of equal size,
//    so the compressed q has spectrum {-1/3, +1/3}, each with half the level's multiplicity, on every level.
// 3. THE WALL (L2 reading of an L1 fact). E-SPN-0168's slab is built of the same tone-blind pieces, so every light wall
//    level (8-fold at k = 0) carries charge -1/3 or +1/3, at every depth: fractional on every light wall level.
// 4. THE TURN SIGN (L1). The full turn lifts to L(e_01)^2 = -1 on the register (E-FRC-0267), commuting with J: -1 on
//    each half and on every wall level. Spin one half holds in both halves; it is the charge that fails.
// 5. THE JOIN IS A NEUTRAL CURRENT (L1). E-FRC-0273's S -> D channel moves two half + members to two half - members and
//    acts as 1 on their tones, so a pair of tones (t1, t2) leaves with the same tones: Q_in = Q_out for every tone pair
//    (-2/3 -> -2/3 for two love-sea holes). The species it changes is the half, which the charge does not see.
// 6. NO CONSERVED REGISTER CHARGE IS A FUREY NUMBER OPERATOR (L1). Every one-body piece is left-type on the register
//    (E-SPN-0163 point 4), so the conserved register charges are the commutant, the right multiplications R(Cl+(4)):
//    real dimension 8, M2(C) + M2(C) on the two halves' isospin index with the spin index a spectator. With the SU(2)+
//    field (2T on half + by right multiplication, irreducible on its isospin) half + keeps only its scalar: dimension 1 +
//    4 = 5. Every Hermitian element then has every eigenvalue at even multiplicity (the spin index doubles it), so no
//    conserved register charge has the multiplicities 1, 3, 3, 1 of Furey's Q = N/3 (arXiv 1603.04078), and none can give
//    one member charge one while its partners in the register carry other thirds.
//
// PROBES BEFORE THE GATES, DISCLOSED.
//  tmp/mc-probe1.log (75 s): E-SPN-0168's chiral slab, unlifted, half 0 at L = 4 .. 12: the light levels |eps| 0.11447,
//   0.07294, 0.02441, 0.00489, 0.00012 at k = 0 (8-fold each, E-SPN-0168's A2), next level at least 0.707; half 1 has no
//   level below 0.76 (no wall), so every light wall level is in half 0.
//  tmp/mc-probe2.log (5 s): the one-class slab (E-SPN-0160's member) of each half, lifted: the member levels +-0.38025
//   (k = 0) and +-0.45930 (k = (0.3, 0.1, 0.2, 0)), q compressed reads -1/3 and +1/3 on every level of both halves (to
//   6 printed places); with the tone-swapping lift U (x) sigma_x it reads 0 on every level. sectorSymmetries and
//   joinChannel in 5.4 s, scale 0.04340, Schur 9.0e-17, 3 source states.
//  tmp/mc-probe3.log (under 1 s): the exact commutant on the register. A first attempt used the rescaled projectors
//   (Q_S = 24 Q_S / 24 has entries 1/24) and rounded them to integers, which zeroed most blocks and gave dimension 32: a
//   flaw in the probe, fixed by using the integer pieces 24 Q_S and 48 Q_D. Then: 128 distinct nonzero 8 x 8 blocks,
//   commutant dimension 8, and 5 with the 24 elements of 2T on half +.
//  tmp/mc-smoke.log (24 s): every code path on the smoke plan (L = 4 and 6, k = 0), before the gates were fixed: H1, H2,
//   H3 false, every level -1/3 and +1/3 (worst 2.2e-16), commutant 8 and 5 with multiplicities 2,2,2,2 and 2,4,2, the
//   tone swap 7.9e-16; C3 missed only because its commutator was read as the largest entry of T times 4/3 (0.083), not
//   the operator norm (T is a partial isometry, norm 1): a flaw in the reading, fixed, and the 0.1 threshold kept.
//   tmp/mc-smoke2.log: the same after the fix.
//
// HYPOTHESES AND GATES, fixed before the gate run, never moved.
//  I1 INSTRUMENT: (a) the count 3Q = loves - fears equals E-FRC-0170's charge3 on all 27 triples (the positron +3, the
//     electron -3, the neutrino 0); (b) the pieces are integer (24 Q_S, 48 Q_D, 1 + J, and the Wilson products) and the
//     slab reductions leak at most 1e-12; (c) every lifted cycle's eigenvectors satisfy |U v - e^(i phi) v| <= 1e-10 and
//     every light level has even multiplicity.
//  C1 CONTROL, the reading can return another value: the tone-swapping lift U (x) sigma_x (a piece that turns love into
//     fear) compressed to every light level (register member and wall) reads 0 to 1e-12, not +-1/3.
//  C2 CONTROL, whole charge is readable: exact Fock count on one dock (8 register modes x 2 tones): the full seas 3Q = 0;
//     the 16 one-hole states 3Q = -1 (8) and +1 (8); the 56 states with three love-sea holes 3Q = -3 (Q = -1); no state
//     with fewer than three holes has |3Q| = 3.
//  C3 CONTROL, a charged contact is seen: the join with its tones turned, T (x) |fear fear><love love|, reads Q_in +2/3 and
//     Q_out -2/3 (Delta Q = -4/3) to 1e-12, and the operator norm of its commutator with the pair charge is above 0.1.
//  H1 ROUTE LINE 163 (the register member alone carries charge one in some half; predicted FALSE): on the one-class slab
//     (E-SPN-0160 at u = ringUnit(-1, 4)) of half 0 and half 1, at k = 0 and three Weyl momenta, some member level (|eps|
//     < pi/2) has a charge eigenvalue within 1e-9 of +-1. Read with it: L(e_01)^2 = -1 on each half, exactly.
//  H2 ROUTE LINE 160 (some light wall level carries charge one; predicted FALSE): on E-SPN-0168's chiral slab (heavy
//     unit ringUnit(-2, 5), Wilson on half 0, profile Wilson on the first L/2 classes), L = 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, at k = 0 and
//     k = (0.1, 0, 0, 0), every level with |eps| < M_H / 2 (0.380) of either half: some charge eigenvalue within 1e-9 of
//     +-1.
//  H3 ROUTE LINE 573 (the join changes charge; predicted FALSE): for E-FRC-0273's S -> D channel lifted to the tones,
//     some source state (a_k (x) tone pair, 3 x 4) has |Q_out - Q_in| above 1e-9, or the lifted channel's commutator with
//     the pair charge is above 1e-12.
//  P1 THE FALSIFIER (points 2 and 3): on every light level read under H1 and H2, the compressed charge has spectrum
//     exactly {-1/3, +1/3} to 1e-12 with equal multiplicities; the commutant on the register has dimension 8, and 5 with
//     the SU(2)+ field (exact, integer elimination); a generic Hermitian element of each (Weyl weights) has every
//     eigenvalue at even multiplicity (clusters at 1e-9). P1 failing would mean the derivation is wrong.
// VERDICT, fixed before the run: FAIL (as derived: all three routes killed) when H1, H2 and H3 are false and I1, C1, C2,
//  C3 and P1 hold; PASS when some route's hypothesis holds and I1 and the controls hold; PARTIAL otherwise.
// READ, gating nothing: the light levels' |eps| and multiplicities, the turn sign on the register, the members with
//  whole charge one under SU(2)+'s Gauss law (E-FRC-0273: N+ even), and the lowest member count that can carry it.
//
// WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT SHOW. It reads the charge the model defines, (love - fear)/3, on the rule's own pieces. A
// fail kills the three routes as written: no register member, no light wall level and no join pair carries or moves
// charge one. It cannot rule out a charge-one composite (three like-tone members, route 161's question beyond two
// members), a charge read some other way (a hypercharge built from T3 and the tone, line 665), or a new piece that
// changes tone (Harari's rearrangement, line 574). The wall's fractional charge here is one vibe, not the Jackiw-Rebbi
// e/2 of a half-filled Dirac sea: the rule's vacuum is the full sea of each tone, whose charge is 0 on every slot. The
// commutant reading is for one-body charges on one member's register only.
//
// FIRST RUN 2026-10-02 (tmp/mc-run1.log, 1547 s): FAIL, as derived; all three routes killed. No gate moved, none rerun.
//  - H1 false: 16 member levels (8 in each half; |eps| 0.38025 at k = 0, 0.42730, 0.41981, 0.44186 at the Weyl momenta,
//    8-fold) carry charge -1/3 and +1/3, 8 each per lifted level; L(e_01)^2 = -1 exactly and keeps the halves.
//  - H2 false: 20 light wall levels, all in half 0 (half 1 holds none below 0.380): |eps| 0.114466, 0.072936, 0.024406,
//    0.004886, 0.000122 at k = 0 and 0.128992, 0.095492, 0.066792, 0.062377, 0.062185 at k = (0.1, 0, 0, 0), L = 4 .. 12,
//    each -1/3 and +1/3; worst ||q| - 1/3| over all 36 levels 5.6e-16.
//  - H3 false: the S -> D channel (scale 0.04340, Schur 9.0e-17) takes every tone pair to itself, worst Delta Q 0 and
//    commutator 0; two love-sea holes -2/3 -> -2/3.
//  - P1 holds: spectra {-1/3, +1/3} balanced; commutant 8 and 5 (exact), generic multiplicities 2,2,2,2 and 2,4,2,
//    transpose closure 0.
//  - I1: 27 triples match, pieces integer, leak 6.3e-15, eigen residual 1.6e-12, every level even. C1: the tone swap reads
//    at most 2.5e-15 on 82 levels. C2: full seas 3Q = 0, one hole -1 (8) and +1 (8), three love-sea holes -3 in 56 of 56,
//    none with fewer holes whole. C3: the planted contact Delta Q -4/3, commutator norm 4/3.
//  THE AUDIT. Points 1, 2 and 5 are bookkeeping: once the tone is a species label that every piece leaves alone, each
//  member is one vibe and no tone-blind piece moves charge, so the level readings confirm the lift is done right more
//  than they test the physics. The content is in what follows: an electron needs three like-tone members (two half +
//  and one half -, or three half -, under SU(2)+'s Gauss law), and no conserved one-body register charge can give a single
//  member a whole charge in Furey's way, since every eigenvalue is at least 2-fold. The run took 26 minutes, most of it
//  the dense lifted eigensolves at L = 10 and 12.
//
// DETERMINISM: no random numbers (Weyl momenta and Weyl weights). EXACT: the triple counts, the Fock counts, the
// commutant dimensions (BigInt elimination) and L(e_01)^2; the level charges are floats, as measurement, with residuals.
