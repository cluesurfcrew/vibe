// H2+ WITH ONE REGISTER MEMBER, THE BONDING LEVEL TRACKED BY ITS OVERLAP (E-SPN-0191, roadmap item 7, atoms;
// routes/matter-forces-numbers.md section E, chemical bonds, the row "H2+ with one register member": H2+ binds at 2.0 a_B
// with a depth about 0.205 of the atom's E_b; killed by no minimum, or a minimum away from 2 a_B that does not move toward
// it as a_B grows). E-SPN-0190 (spin/register-member-h2plus) put E-SPN-0160's light register member (u = ringUnit(-5,
// 1), m 0.427029) on two fixed sources of the husk light's Coulomb law and failed on its own tracking rule: it read the
// genuine line (|modulus - 1| under 1e-4) of largest weight; the bonding line, at |modulus - 1| 2e-5 to 1e-4 at N 700
// to 1,000, fell outside that cut at 7 of 16 separations and the read jumped to deep core lines of weight under 0.02.
// Its stated remedy: overlap tracking against the fixed start (as spin/register-coulomb-track does), N at least doubled,
// and a check that the core lines stay light. This file is that rerun. E-SPN-0190's file is not changed.
//
// WHAT IS RUN. Everything of E-SPN-0190 except the read: the same member engine (code/measure/register-member-field,
// the vector form, beat 1 = 1 + (w1 - 1) Q_S, beat 2 = 1 + (w2 - 1) Q_D', w1 = u e^(i phi), w2 = conj(u) e^(i phi)),
// the same field phi(y) = alpha sum_k G(y - X_k) (G the infinite husk Green's function), the same mass mu = 4 tan m,
// alpha = 24 pi / (mu a_B), E_b = 1 / (2 mu a_B^2), the same region (docks within 4.5 a_B of the segment, absorbing
// edge), the same start (the LCAO profile exp(-r1 / a_B) + p exp(-r2 / a_B), p = +1 gerade and -1 ungerade, in the D
// coordinates, register label 0, unit in the metric G), and the same harmonic inversion of c_l = <G v | U^l v>, read
// at binding b = E - (pi - M0). The total energy in the atom's units is e(R) = (-b(R) + alpha G(R)) / b_atom.
//
// DERIVED BEFORE THE GATE RUN.
// 1. THE OVERLAP. c is the start's own autocorrelation with no filter, so a line's weight from harmonicLines is its
//    overlap with the start, |<psi_j | G v>|^2 (v unit): the quantity spin/register-coulomb-track tracks. The start is
//    the same function of R / a_B and y / a_B at every point, so the tracked level is the line the fixed start
//    overlaps most, not the heaviest line among those that pass a modulus cut.
// 2. THE BONDING LEVEL IS A MULTIPLET, SO ITS READ IS A CENTROID (probes 1 and 2). At a_B 3 the start's bonding weight
//    sits on a cluster of lines within 0.15 E_b: at R 5 docks a resolved pair 2.509 and 2.545 E_b (overlaps 0.26 and
//    0.30, the same at N 2,000, 3,000, 4,000 to 0.005 E_b); at R 6 docks a cluster 2.31 to 2.45 E_b that the inversion
//    splits differently at each N (largest line 2.313, 2.327, 2.315 at N 4,000, 3,000, 2,000 with overlap 0.26, 0.19,
//    0.31). The one-source atom is a single clean line (E-SPN-0190 probe 3). Which member of the cluster carries the
//    most overlap is set by the resolution, so the level read is the overlap-weighted centroid of the genuine lines
//    within BAND = 0.2 E_b of the largest-overlap line: b = sum w_j b_j / sum w_j. That centroid moved by 0.002 E_b
//    from N 3,000 to 4,000 at R 6 and by 0.001 at R 5 (a_B 3), and by 0.0014 from N 1,500 to 2,000 at a_B 2.5, R 5;
//    from N 1,000 to 2,000 at a_B 3, R 6 it moved by 0.016. A line is counted as genuine at |modulus - 1| under 1e-3
//    (the cluster's lines sit at 2e-6 to 3e-4; the S-branch alias lies far outside the window).
// 3. THE WINDOW. b in [-0.5, 6] E_b: it holds the bonding cluster (b 2.3 to 2.6), the antibonding level (above 1) and
//    the cores' deep lines that carry weight 1e-3 or more (3.4 to 5.2 E_b in probe 2); one deeper core line (21 to 26
//    E_b, overlap under 0.012, |modulus - 1| 1e-2 to 0.3 at these N) lies outside and is not counted. L = ceil(width /
//    (2 pi / N)) + 1 basis phases.
// 4. THE CORE LINES. The core weight is the summed overlap of the window's lines deeper than the tracked line by more
//    than 0.5 E_b (probe 2 at a_B 3: 0.015 at R 6, 0.025 at R 5; probe 3 at a_B 2.5, R 5: 0.040, largest single 0.016).
// 5. THE RESOLUTION. N 2,000 at a_B 3 and 1,600 at a_B 2.5 (E-SPN-0190's 1,000 and 700, doubled and more; the bin 2 pi
//    / N is 0.103 and 0.089 E_b). The read is repeated from the first 3N / 4 lags of the same correlation; the
//    centroids must agree.
// 6. THE MINIMUM, as E-SPN-0190 point 4: the scan's lowest e interior, R_min and e_min from the parabola through it and
//    its two neighbours, D = -1 - e_min. Continuum (Burrau; Bates, Ledsham and Stewart): R_min 1.997 a_B, D 0.2053.
//
// PROBES BEFORE THE GATES (tmp/h2-probe1.ts; logs tmp/h2-probe1-3-6.log, h2-probe2-3-6.log, h2-probe2-3-5.log,

//   1 a_B 3, R 6, gerade, N 2,000 and 1,000, window to 25 E_b: the cluster of point 2 and the core lines of points 3 and

//     core weight 0.040. Ungerade: the start spreads over a smear of lines from 0.8 to 2.0 E_b, the largest overlap
//     0.084 (1.874 E_b), its band centroid 1.907, 1.906, 1.895 at N 2,000, 1,500, 1,000: the antibonding level is not
//     one resolved line at this N, so the control below reads a centroid of a smear and is not a hard gate
//   From these probes e(R) at a_B 3 near 2 a_B is about -1.13 to -1.14 (D about 0.13 to 0.14, under H1's band) and at
//   a_B 2.5, 2 a_B about -1.18. The bands below are the route's, as E-SPN-0190 fixed them, not moved to the probes.
//

// (1.2 to 3.6 a_B), the ungerade control at R = 3, 5, 8; a_B 3, N 2,000, gerade at R = 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11 (1.33 to
// 3.67 a_B); the atom at both; thirteen two-source reads and two atoms, sized for the loaded machine)
//   I1 the instrument (hard): E-SPN-0190's, the field-free cycle on a Bloch state equals memberCycle(u, K) within
//      1e-13, and the D branch's kinetic mass from diracPhase within 1e-3 of 4 tan m
//   T1 the tracking (hard): at both atoms and every gerade point the largest-overlap line has overlap at least 0.2,
//      the band around it holds overlap at least 0.4, and the core weight is at most 0.1
//   T2 the resolution (not hard): at every gerade point and both atoms the centroid from 3N / 4 lags within 0.01 E_b
//      of the centroid from N
//   C1 the control (not hard): the ungerade centroid at a_B 2.5 gives e(R) falling strictly over R = 3, 5, 8
//   H1 the route's hypothesis, at a_B 3: e(R) has an interior minimum with R_min / a_B in [1.7, 2.3] and D in [0.16,
//      0.25]
//   H2 the trend (not hard): from a_B 2.5 to 3, |R_min / a_B - 2| does not grow by more than 0.05 and |D - 0.2053| not
//      by more than 0.005
//   P1 the falsifier (the route's kill): no interior minimum at a_B 3, or R_min / a_B outside [1.7, 2.3] at a_B 3 and
//      no closer to 2 than at a_B 2.5
// VERDICT: fail if I1 or T1 fails, or P1 holds, or H1 fails; partial if H1 holds and T2, C1 or H2 fails; pass
// otherwise.
//
// WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT SHOW. It can show whether the register member, run exactly on the rule's pieces, has a
// bonding level on two fixed husk-Coulomb charges whose total energy has a minimum, where it lies in a_B, and how
// deep it is in the lattice atom's units, at two couplings, with the level identified by its overlap with a fixed
// start and its core admixture measured. The read is the centroid of a multiplet the inversion does not split stably,
// so a structure inside it (the register's) is not read. It cannot show anything about nuclei the rule makes (the
// sources are fixed and put in by hand, labeled stand-in) or about the nuclei's motion, and two couplings at which
// the lattice atom is 13 to 17 percent overbound are not the a_B -> infinity limit.
//
// FIRST RUN 2026-10-02 (tmp/h2-run1.log, 1,053 s on the loaded machine): FAIL (T1; T2 and H2 not met; I1, H1 and C1
// hold, P1 does not).
//   I1 pass: the field-free cycle against memberCycle 7.0e-16; mu 1.820204 on the axis and the face against 4 tan m
//      1.820121
//   a_B 3, N 2,000, every point held T1 and T2 (largest overlap 0.24 to 0.55, band 0.47 to 0.76, core weight 0.013 to
//      0.026, the 3N / 4 centroid within 0.006 E_b). b (E_b) and e at R 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11 docks: 2.8134 -1.15838,
//      2.5229 -1.16653, 2.3372 -1.17909, 2.1706 -1.15817, 2.0546 -1.15030, 1.9368 -1.11995, 1.7740 -1.08328. The
//      minimum is interior at R 6: R_min 1.958 a_B, e_min -1.17935, D 0.1793 (continuum 1.997 and 0.2053). H1 holds
//   a_B 2.5, N 1,600: R 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9: b 2.8653, 2.5750, 2.3411, 2.2547, 2.0227, 1.8269; e -1.01274, -1.11859,
//      -1.13204, -1.19969, -1.10437, -1.07311. T1 FAILS at two points: R 4 (largest overlap 0.176) and R 6 (0.172, band
//      0.352); R 6 also fails T2 (its centroid moved by 0.068 E_b from 3N / 4 to N, the next largest drift 0.004). The
//      curve's lowest point is that failed R 6 point, so its minimum (2.366 a_B, D 0.2003) rests on a read the gates
//      reject. H2 fails: R_min moves toward 2 a_B (|R_min / a_B - 2| 0.366 to 0.042) but |D - 0.2053| grows from 0.005
//      to 0.026
//   C1 holds as written (ungerade e -0.4820, -0.8105, -0.9240 at R 3, 5, 8), but on reads the probe already showed to
//      be centroids of a smear: largest overlap 0.057 and 0.072 at R 3 and 5, and at R 3 the 3N / 4 centroid sits at
//      1.213 E_b against 2.237 from N. It is not evidence that the instrument reads "no minimum"
//   A DEFECT OF POINT 2, seen in the run: the atoms are not single lines inside the band. The largest-overlap atom line
//      is 1.1715 E_b at a_B 3 (overlap 0.551, E-SPN-0190's line) and 1.1337 at a_B 2.5 (0.306, E-SPN-0190's 1.134),
//      but the 0.2 E_b band pulls in neighbours, so the centroids that normalize e are 1.1341 and 1.1848: 3.2 percent
//      below and 4.5 percent above the main lines. Normalized by the main lines instead (after the run, not a gate),
//      D would be 0.142 at a_B 3 and 0.254 at a_B 2.5. So the depth here carries a normalization error of a few
//      percent of e, larger than the gap between D and the continuum's 0.205; R_min does not depend on it.
//   What this run reads: at a_B 3, with the level identified by its overlap and the core lines light (under 0.03), the
//      bonding level's total energy has an interior minimum near 2 a_B (1.96). What it does not read: a depth to better
//      than the atom normalization's few percent, or a trend with a_B, since the a_B 2.5 curve fails its own tracking
//      gate at two of six points. A rerun needs the atom's normalization read by the same rule as the clean line (a
//      band that holds only the main line, or the main line itself) and a_B 2.5 at larger N or a third a_B above 3.
