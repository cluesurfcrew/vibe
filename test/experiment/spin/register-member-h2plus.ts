// H2+ WITH ONE REGISTER MEMBER (E-SPN-0190, roadmap item 7, atoms; routes/matter-forces-numbers.md section E, chemical
// bonds, the row "H2+ with one register member": one member and two fixed charges, energy against separation; H2+ binds
// at 2.0 a_B with a depth about 0.205 of the atom's E_b; killed by no minimum, or a minimum away from 2 a_B that does not
// move toward it as a_B grows). The bond rows so far are stand-ins (E-MTR-0007: a fear-walk stand-in electron on two
// fixed stand-in nuclei, bond at 1.57 a0 at a0 = 4 docks) or textbook (E-SPN-0023). This file puts E-SPN-0160's register
// member itself, the light member of E-SPN-0173 (u = ringUnit(-5, 1), m 0.427029), on two fixed sources of the husk
// light's Coulomb law, exactly in its moving block, and reads the bonding level against the separation.
//
// WHY THIS ROW AND NOT THE STARK ROW (the item names both). The linear Stark row needs the n = 2 levels resolved to a
// fraction of the 2s-2p gap on a register atom, which the only register-atom engine (the pair, spin/register-coulomb-weak,
// -track) reaches only in hours a point, and whose levels are register multiplets. H2+ needs only the bonding ground
// level, isolated by about 1.5 E_b from the next level of its parity, on a one-body engine: minutes a separation.
//
// WHAT IS RUN (code/measure/register-member-field, written for this file). One member in W = S + T D (16 coordinates a
// dock) on the husk quotient (docks Z^3), the cycle beat 1 = 1 + (w1 - 1) Q_S, beat 2 = 1 + (w2 - 1) Q_D', with w1(x) = u
// e^(i phi(x)) and w2(y) = conj(u) e^(i phi(y)): the vector form of a static potential (the same phase on both sectors),
// each beat 1 plus orthogonal projectors times a phase minus 1, so exactly unitary and exactly inside W. phi(y) = alpha
// sum_k G(y - X_k), G the infinite husk Green's function (E-FRC-0241, register-coulomb's table: 1 / (24 pi r) + A / r^5,
// G(0) = 0.052831), X_k the fixed sources on the x axis, R docks apart. The region: the docks within 4.5 a_B of the
// segment between the sources (absorbing edge). The level is read by harmonic inversion (register-reduced's
// harmonicLines) of c_l = <G v | U^l v>, v a start with the gerade LCAO profile exp(-r1 / a_B) + exp(-r2 / a_B) in the D
// coordinates (register label 0) and nothing in S.
//
// DERIVED BEFORE THE GATE RUN.
// 1. THE MEMBER'S TWO BRANCHES. At K = 0 the overlap C(0) = sum_d C(r_d) vanishes (the roots sum to zero), so the free
//    cycle is diag(u, conj u): the S coordinates carry the branch at phase theta0 = -2.287534 and the D coordinates the
//    branch at pi - M0 = +2.287534 (M0 0.854058). A vector potential adds phi to both; phi > 0 lifts the D branch into
//    the gap (bound, phase above pi - M0) and pushes the S branch into its own continuum. So the start lives in D and a
//    bound line's binding is b = E - (pi - M0).
// 2. THE MASS. The D branch's phase is pi - E(K), E the member's Dirac phase (spinor-register diracPhase): its curvature
//    gives the kinetic mass per cycle in husk docks, mu = 4 tan m = 1.820121 (probe 4; twice the 2 tan m the pair files
//    use for one member's share of their reduced mass, because the pair's relative coordinate is that file's unit). The
//    Coulomb scale is set as continuum hydrogen with this mass: alpha = 24 pi / (mu a_B), E_b = 1 / (2 mu a_B^2), the
//    contact phase alpha G(0) = 2.1890 / a_B rad a cycle (0.73 at a_B 3), alpha' = 1 / (mu a_B) = 0.18 at a_B 3 (the
//    Dirac correction to E_b about alpha'^2 / 4, under 1 percent).
// 3. THE TOTAL ENERGY. e(R) = (-b(R) + alpha G(R)) / b_atom, b_atom the one-source binding read the same way at the same
//    a_B and region rule: the source-source repulsion is the same husk law. Continuum H2+ (Burrau 1927; Bates, Ledsham
//    and Stewart 1953): e_min = -1.2053 at R = 1.997 a_B, so the depth D = -1 - e_min = 0.2053; the antibonding sigma_u
//    level gives e(R) falling monotonically to -1 over R 1 to 4 a_B (its van der Waals minimum sits near 12.5 a_B).
// 4. THE READING OF THE MINIMUM. The scan's lowest e must be interior; R_min and e_min come from the parabola through it
//    and its two neighbours.
// 5. THE TRACKING RULE (the core states of probe 3). The level read is the genuine line (|modulus - 1| under 1e-4) of
//    largest weight in the window b in [-0.3, 8] E_b. Lines deeper than the window exist: a core-bound line at 20.5 E_b
//    (weight 0.009) at a_B 3; lines at 2.686 and 4.108 E_b of weight 0.010 and 0.002 lie inside the window but carry a
//    fiftieth of the main line's weight. The hydrogenic level is the one the hydrogenic start overlaps most.
//
// PROBES BEFORE THE GATES (tmp/at-probe1.ts, at-probe2.ts, at-disp.ts; one source only, no two-source run was made):
//   1 the instrument (free cycle on a Bloch state at K = (0.3, 0.1, -0.2) against memberCycle, 7.0e-16) and the cost
//     (5 to 6 us a dock a cycle on the loaded machine). An S-coordinate start: its weight sits on the S branch, which is
//     how point 1 was found
//   2 a_B "5" with the wrong mass (2 tan m, so a true a_B 2.5): an unresolved blob of lines at 0.4 to 2.8 E_b at N 400
//   3, 4 the atom at a_B 3, mass 4 tan m, region 4.5 a_B (10,395 docks): at N 1,000 the main line at phase 2.3232759 to
//     2.3232797 over three windows (b 1.1710 to 1.1711 E_b, weight 0.55 to 0.57, |modulus - 1| 5e-6 to 2e-5); at N 500
//     1.1821. So the lattice atom is bound 17 percent more than continuum hydrogen at a_B 3, and N 1,000 fixes its line
//     to about 1e-4 E_b. 60 ms a cycle there
//   dispersion: mu from diracPhase at K 0.01 on the axis and the face diagonal 1.820204 and 1.820204 (4 tan m 1.820121)
//
// HYPOTHESES AND GATES (fixed before the gate run; PLAN: a_B 3 at R = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 docks with N 1,000;
// a_B 2.5 at R = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 with N 700; the atoms at both; the sigma_u control at a_B 2.5, R = 3, 4, 5, 7, 10)
//   I1 the instrument (hard): the field-free cycle on a Bloch state equals memberCycle(u, K) within 1e-13 on docks five
//      links inside a ball of 8, and the D branch's kinetic mass from diracPhase within 1e-3 of 4 tan m
//   T1 the tracking (hard): at every gerade point and both atoms the tracked line exists with weight at least 0.2
//   C1 the control (not hard): the sigma_u start (profile exp(-r1 / a_B) - exp(-r2 / a_B)) at a_B 2.5 gives e(R)
//      falling monotonically over its five separations: the instrument can read "no minimum"
//   H1 the route's hypothesis, at a_B 3: e(R) has an interior minimum with R_min / a_B in [1.7, 2.3] and D in [0.16,
//      0.25]
//   H2 the trend (not hard): from a_B 2.5 to 3, |R_min / a_B - 2| does not grow by more than 0.05 and |D - 0.2053| not
//      by more than 0.005
//   P1 the falsifier (the route's kill): no interior minimum at a_B 3, or R_min / a_B outside [1.7, 2.3] at a_B 3 and no
//      closer to 2 than at a_B 2.5
// VERDICT: fail if I1 or T1 fails, or P1 holds, or H1 fails; partial if H1 holds and C1 or H2 fails; pass otherwise.
//
// WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT SHOW. It can show that the register member, run exactly on the rule's pieces, binds two fixed
// husk-Coulomb charges into a molecule ion with the continuum's bond length and depth to within the lattice term at
// a_B 3 (where the atom itself is 17 percent too bound). It cannot show anything about nuclei the rule makes (the
// sources are fixed and put in by hand, labeled stand-in), about the Born-Oppenheimer motion of the nuclei, or about
// a_B large against the lattice: a_B 4 costs about four times a_B 3 a point and is not run here.
//
// RENUMBERED after the run from E-SPN-0187 (reserved for the R scan, handoff 2026-10-02) to E-SPN-0190; nothing
// else changed.
// FIRST RUN 2026-10-02 (tmp/at-run1.log, 900 s on the loaded machine): FAIL (T1, H1, P1; C1 and H2 not met).
//   I1 pass: the field-free cycle against memberCycle 7.0e-16; mu 1.820204 on the axis and the face against 4 tan m
//      1.820121
//   The atoms: b 1.1342 E_b (weight 0.305) at a_B 2.5, 1.1710 E_b (weight 0.561) at a_B 3 (the probe's line, to 1e-5)
//   T1 FAILS, and the cause is a defect of point 5's rule, not a reading of the bond. The hydrogenic line, at the N
//      planned, has |modulus - 1| from 2e-5 to 1e-4, against the genuine cut of 1e-4; where it fell outside the cut, the
//      largest-weight genuine line left was one of the deep core lines (weight 0.005 to 0.016, binding 3.2 to 3.7 E_b)
//      that the two cores hold, and e(R) jumped to about -2. Points with the tracked weight 0.2 or more:
//        a_B 3:   R 3: e -0.974755 (w 0.237); R 4: -1.148349 (0.304); R 6: -1.118774 (0.331); R 7: -1.132850 (0.481);
//                 R 8: -1.111441 (0.500); R 9: -1.090918 (0.506). R 5, 10, 12 tracked a core line (w 0.009, 0.008,
//                 0.008; e -2.09, -2.32, -2.31)
//        a_B 2.5: R 3: -1.050701 (0.423); R 10: -1.117297 (0.335). R 6 at 0.164 (-1.3237); R 4, 5, 7, 8 core lines
//      The parabola read on the mixed curve (R_min 3.66 a_B, D 1.72 at a_B 3; 3.00 a_B, 1.21 at a_B 2.5) is a core line,
//      not the bonding level, and is not a result
//   C1 (the sigma_u control) tracked a core line at all five separations (weight 0.005 to 0.013): it read nothing
//   AFTER THE RUN (not gates, not a result). Even the heavy points do not form a smooth curve (at a_B 3, R 4 lies below
//      R 6 and R 7 below R 6), so the heavy line at these N is itself a blend of unresolved lines, not one level. What
//      the next run needs, read from this one: the overlap-tracking rule of spin/register-coulomb-track (the line of
//      largest overlap with the fixed start, its genuineness judged at two N), N at least doubled, and a scan that
//      shows the core lines' weight staying small. Nothing here says whether the register member binds two fixed
//      charges at 2 a_B.
